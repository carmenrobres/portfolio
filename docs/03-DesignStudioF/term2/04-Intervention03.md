## Interview with Inés Blanc, a Neuroepigenetic Researcher
### The interview: Trauma can be passed down through 5 generations.
This final intervention marks another stage of my learning journey. Throughout this second trimester, I've strived to comprehend the technologies I intend to utilize to enhance mental health and address my inquiry into how to "hack" the brain. In the first intervention, I delved into understanding artificial intelligence and its potential application in decoding human identity and language. Subsequently, I utilized AI to understand the workings of various technologies and how to develop an element that aids in mental health improvement. **Now, in this third intervention, my focus shifts to understanding the brain itself.**

Essentially, if my goal is to "hack" the brain, **how do scientists comprehend mental health and trauma, enabling me to understand it better?** In this regard, I conducted an interview with a friend, Inés, who is an epigenetics scientist specializing in researching trauma and mental health. Their findings reveal that individuals experiencing trauma undergo changes in their epigenetics, affecting their interaction with and response to their environment, with repercussions extending up to the fifth generation.

*Important highlights of the interview*
> “Personally, I'm not keen on messing with hacking our brains. We don't really understand science well enough to think we can do better than nature. To me, epigenetics is like nature's way of adapting. Your parents faced challenges and had to adapt, so they want to set you up with the best tools to survive in this world. I wouldn't mess with that unless it's absolutely necessary, because nature is trying to make you fit in the best way possible.

>What's the bottom line? Either this whole cycle starts or ends with us. It's more about realizing these effects; they'll just keep going if we, as individuals, don't do something about it. Epigenetics reflects our surroundings, so even if my trauma is something I inherited, getting therapy can still make a big difference in my mental health and break the cycle.”

### Reflection

My conversation with Inés lasted an hour and a half and provided profound insights, particularly into her scientific perspective on the concept of "hacking" the brain. **Essentially, she aims not to alter our brain's functioning but to gain insights that can lead to better understanding and management of mental health. Inés' viewpoint was intriguing; she emphasized that while the notion of trauma passing through generations via epigenetics may evoke concern, the focus should be on taking proactive measures.**

Acknowledging that trauma alters one's worldview, the emphasis lies on seeking therapy and making efforts to prevent future generations from enduring similar challenges. While trauma may have epigenetic implications, it doesn't guarantee the development of mental disorders in subsequent generations; it just indicates a predisposition. Therefore, aiding oneself can prevent such disorders from manifesting.

This interview enlightened me on the communicative aspect of science and highlighted the complexity of "hacking" the brain. Scientists understand the inputs and outputs but struggle to comprehend intricate processes like language acquisition or emotional regulation.**Inés' insight also underscored the importance of creating technologies that facilitate self-awareness and emotional understanding without imposing on our natural tendencies.**

The objective isn't to eradicate sadness or trauma entirely but to develop technologies that assist in managing emotions without opposing their natural flow. **Consequently, the challenge lies in creating non-intrusive technologies that enhance mental well-being while respecting the innate processes of the human mind. Ultimately, it's about crafting tools that aid in self-discovery and emotional regulation, promoting a deeper understanding of ourselves without imposing artificial constraints on our mental states.**

In the context of transhumanism, the possibility of hacking our brains is indeed conceivable, yet it provokes profound questions about ethics and the essence of human identity. While researchers and scientists are beginning to comprehend our brains and generational trauma, there are numerous ethical implications regarding this type of research that still require reflection. Do we truly want to alter our epigenetics to reduce the trauma inherited across generations? Is combating generational trauma comparable to battling cancer, or does it risk compromising our human experience and resilience?  We must be careful in contemplating the intersection of technology and mental health, as ultimately, we are fighting with the essence of our own nature.
