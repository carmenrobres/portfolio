## Network of co-responsibility
Goals: Reflect on your network of co-responsibility. Voicing others: A 1PP Design intervention in context giving the stage to your peers and communities (human and non-humans). Let the human and non-human actors be a driving force in your project.

Activity: Present your results from your 1PP design intervention. Reflect on how you can iterate this intervention, this time allowing others to take the lead.

Task: Plan and execute a 2nd design intervention, a collective design intervention with this perspective.

Deliverable: Document the 2nd collective design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings.

## Second Intervention
This is still a work in progress because my second intervention depends on the final prototype of MIcroChallenge1. Check the [Fabrication files](https://github.com/carmenrobres/microchallenge1) to see how it went :)
