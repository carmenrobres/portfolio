# Design Studio

## Roles of Prototying
![](../images/Designstydio/PROTOTYPING.svg){style: width="380", align=right}
This was my first design studio class, and it was fascinating to discuss the different roles of prototyping and reflect on my own experiences with it. As an industrial design engineer, I have primarily engaged in role 1 prototyping. Initially, I perceived a prototype as a preliminary version of a functional object. To me, prototyping often involves navigating through frustrations, time constraints, and the pursuit of perfection.

After the seminar, I became interested in roles 2 and 3. Role 2 focuses on gathering information and exploring new ideas, rather than just creating functional objects. This type of prototyping involves learning and collaborating with others. On the other hand, role 3, to me, feels like art — a way to encourage people to think about our society and learn from it. I realized that when I draw, paint, or work with ceramics, I'm essentially creating prototypes that represent issues in our society.

Though I find it challenging to implement role 4 in my current context, I am intrigued by its unique approach to prototyping. It appears to be an exciting and unconventional method that fosters discovery and collaboration through co-design and participatory design processes.

Here are some examples of my prototyping experiences:

>Role 1: Redesign and prototyping of sustainable pulp paper corners for ROS furniture. The project aimed to protect furniture sides while promoting the use of eco-friendly materials in transportation. Despite the need for additional time and specialized tools for precise cutting, it offered efficient and user-friendly protection.

>Role 2: "Create Your Own Coffee Machine" project. Our goal was to understand user preferences for a coffee machine. Through providing different button options and functionalities, we encouraged users to customize their ideal coffee machine.

>Role 3: Exploring art as a means of societal reflection.

>Role 4: Participation in the [Spaghetti Tower Challenge.](https://tinkerlab.com/spaghetti-tower-marshmallow-challenge/)

In the end, I've realized just how important prototypes are in the whole process of creating something, even if they're not perfect. My recent realization has really made me curious about exploring prototyping in a new way, not just to make a final thing, but to learn and improve the whole process of creating something. I'm eager to dive deeper into how prototyping can help us learn, grow, and make our projects even more awesome.
