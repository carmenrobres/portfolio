## Reflection

This course marked my first experience in the second year, and while it didn’t directly tie into my thesis, it was enlightening to explore how colors can be created from natural sources. The initial lecture provided insight into the process of making biocromes, highlighting various techniques for creating dyes from plant, insect, and even bacterial pigments.

Throughout the week, the class shifted into a workshop format where we learned to convert natural materials into inks. I chose to work with purple cabbage, and it was fascinating to witness how the vibrant lilac transformed into different shades of dye. This experience challenged my understanding of color creation and highlighted the complexities involved, particularly with producing green—something I had never considered before.

Even though the course was not directly related to my thesis, it provided valuable knowledge about sustainable practices in an industry notorious for its pollution. The class emphasized the importance of seeking environmentally friendly alternatives in textile dyeing, pushing us to think critically about the materials we use. Overall, it was a captivating journey, and I look forward to sharing the collective conclusions from our group as we collaborated to experiment with various natural colors.
