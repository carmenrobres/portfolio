## Month 1: Proposal
During the first month, we reached out to the site and proposed different exhibit ideas. Our group specifically focused on exploring the connection between the soil and the historical path of Poblenou. Although it was a challenging exercise due to our lack of expertise and the small group dynamic, we decided to create a project inspired by the Tree of Life—a representation of a willow tree made with fiber optics in the Park's central structure.

What I learned this month is that creating a sustainable and economically feasible project is quite difficult when you don't have the knowledge or experience of how to make it happen. It was also challenging to imagine concepts for a large-scale project. I’m eager to see how it all turns out.

Although our project was fairly basic, it still felt complicated. I would have liked to experiment more with interactive systems. I had hoped to incorporate more sensors and different light connections, but the project turned out to be more complex than anticipated. The fiber optics were expensive, and we faced issues with the fabrication and prototyping files. Without architects in our group, it was tough to create a practical, executable project since we lacked the necessary measurements, fabrication files, and knowledge of electronic systems. Now that we’ve chosen a new idea, I’m excited about the possibilities, especially the interactive and physical computing aspects.
