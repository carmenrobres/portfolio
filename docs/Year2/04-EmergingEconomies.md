## Circular Economies and Value Flow

This week’s seminar focused on circular economies and value flows, led by Marion Real, a systemic design expert at Fablab Barcelona. We explored co-creation processes for transitioning towards circular economies and cosmopolitan localism. Marion's work intersects productive cities and material and textile research, engaging with projects like Siscode, Remix el Barrio, Score, Shemakes and Reservist.

While I found the seminar engaging, I struggled to see its relevance to my thesis. The emphasis was on developing circular economies and working with various materials, which feels quite complex to integrate into a project centered on AI. Although AI does have significant material implications, particularly concerning internet usage and energy consumption, I find it challenging to navigate the flows of resources and products in the context of local economies.

Ultimately, while I appreciated the discussion, I realized that my focus is not currently on circular economies. My priority lies in investigating and understanding this tool —AI— that is still largely unknown. Once I feel more confident in my grasp of AI, I’ll be better equipped to explore how to make it more sustainable and circular.


## Distributed Economies and Massive Collaboration



## Social Entrepreneurship and Impact Economies
This course hasn’t provided me with much new information, but it has sparked my interest in how my idea could potentially become a product of social innovation. Currently, my project is primarily focused on research, and I’m uncertain if I’ll have the opportunity to develop an innovation project by the end of the Master's program. I didn’t expect to gain significant insights on social entrepreneurship from this course; rather, I was hoping to learn how to create a resourceful business model centered on a socially innovative project, especially with our newfound understanding of distributed economies.

What I really want to grasp is how to build a specific type of business that prioritizes social good while also being financially sustainable. In my previous job, I worked with businesses that embodied this model—they were incredible but largely local and community-based. My concern is that sometimes we get too caught up in the business side of things and lose sight of the community focus in pursuit of profit. This often leads businesses to expand unnecessarily, diluting their social mission in favor of becoming more resourceful.

Achieving a balance between a meaningful social business that truly benefits communities while also being profitable is challenging. This session has helped refresh my understanding of these dynamics. I believe that such businesses can exist, but sustaining them requires deep interaction with communities, which is a delicate balance to strike. 

In my thesis and project, I’m unsure how to apply all of this knowledge since I’m still in the research phase. My goal is to create something with a social impact—technology that people can freely use to do good. However, I’m unsure how to monetize it. I envision an open-source business model, but I need to clarify the significance of what I’m doing to figure out how to turn it into a viable business.
