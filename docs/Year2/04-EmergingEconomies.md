## Circular Economies and Value Flow

This week’s seminar focused on circular economies and value flows, led by Marion Real, a systemic design expert at Fablab Barcelona. We explored co-creation processes for transitioning towards circular economies and cosmopolitan localism. Marion's work intersects productive cities and material and textile research, engaging with projects like Siscode, Remix el Barrio, Score, Shemakes and Reservist.

While I found the seminar engaging, I struggled to see its relevance to my thesis. The emphasis was on developing circular economies and working with various materials, which feels quite complex to integrate into a project centered on AI. Although AI does have significant material implications, particularly concerning internet usage and energy consumption, I find it challenging to navigate the flows of resources and products in the context of local economies.

Ultimately, while I appreciated the discussion, I realized that my focus is not currently on circular economies. My priority lies in investigating and understanding this tool —AI— that is still largely unknown. Once I feel more confident in my grasp of AI, I’ll be better equipped to explore how to make it more sustainable and circular.
