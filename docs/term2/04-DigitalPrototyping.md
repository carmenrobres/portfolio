### Reflection: The four F’s of active reviewing
 *Facts:* 

- We opted to craft a theater using biomaterials molded with laser cutting because we lacked time for proper drying to use a laser cutter directly. So, We created a mold from laser cutting and let the materials dry naturally
- We had to try twice; initially, we omitted glycerol from the gelatin to keep it rigid, unaware that adding this would cause it to overdry and bend. Although it initially met our rigidity needs, it continued to dry, causing the edges to lift, failing to achieve the desired flat effect.
- In our second attempt, we added glycerol and covered it to prevent rising during drying, but this led to mold formation due to the biomaterials being covered. 
- Despite the limited mold formation on one side, we proceeded as the texture met our requirements. To hang it correctly, we glued the material to acrylic scraps to maintain rigidity (the material did not complety dry so it was a bit fragile), then hung it.

 *Feelings:* 

 - We were disappointed to have to try twice and found that the mistakes were quite common. Firstly, we simply forgot to add glycerol in the first attempt, and in the second, we didn't anticipate that covering the biomaterial and depriving it of air would lead to mold growth, especially since it was in contact with an improperly sealed piece.
 - Additionally, we felt bad because we had to use acrylic for drying the gelatine, which is an expensive material, and that didn't sit well with us since our product had no functional value.

 *Findings:* 

- I've acquired skills in laser cutting and creating biomaterials. 
- I've come to understand that biomaterial recipes are straightforward, yet achieving the desired strength and texture takes time. 
- It's important to reflect on how to maximize material usage in projects.

 *Future:* 

 - The initial try at producing a biomaterial is never final. Therefore, it's advisable to experiment on a small scale beforehand, testing various textures, colors, and drying durations, before settling on the ultimate material.

*Facts:* 

- The printing process was quick as we didn't need to create any new documents or designs; instead, we used one already available online. It took approximately two hours to complete the printing.
- Creating the mycelium ashtray was time-consuming due to the need to disinfect all the materials, which took about 50 minutes.
- Our initial plan to use ashes in the recipe couldn't be realized because we intended to collect the ashes on the same day, but it rained. Consequently, most of the ashtrays had wet ashes that formed a paste, which we decided not to use.
- Setting up the printer was challenging because it was not properly calibrated. It took three attempts before we realized the printing error, and after cleaning and recalibrating it, we managed to print.

*Feelings:* 

- Printing and troubleshooting the printer was an intriguing experience, especially because I had never attempted 3D printing independently before.
- The initial malfunction of the printer turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as it provided me with an opportunity to analyze and manage the issue effectively, leading to a resolution.
- However, waiting for the mycelium to grow is somewhat frustrating, given the uncertainty about the accuracy and functionality of the mold we printed.
- We are eager to determine if the finalized design is indeed suitable for creating a functional ashtray.

*Findings:* 

- My limited experience with 3D printing and Mycelium cultivation has been a significant learning curve throughout this project. I've gained valuable skills in the topic since they were previously unfamiliar to me.
- I was unaware of the extensive time required for mycelium growth and the complexity involved in understanding its growth process.
- Not only is growing mycelium demanding, but comprehending its growth and evolution entails a substantial amount of time and dedication, resources that were limited in this project.
- I was surprised by the necessity of thoroughly disinfecting all materials used in the mycelium cultivation process.

*Future:* 

- In the future, I aim to experiment with creating mycelium using diverse materials, going beyond the standard recipe by incorporating elements such as ashes.
- I'm interested in exploring the growth of mycelium, letting it expand naturally instead of restricting it to molds we've designed, and discovering its potential applications.
- Additionally, I aspire to acquire skills in designing molds that can adapt to mycelium growth, enabling us to craft ashtrays that are more personalized, authentic, and innovative.
