### Reflection: The four F’s of active reviewing
 *Facts:* 

- We opted to craft a theater using biomaterials molded with laser cutting because we lacked time for proper drying to use a laser cutter directly. So, We created a mold from laser cutting and let the materials dry naturally
- We had to try twice; initially, we omitted glycerol from the gelatin to keep it rigid, unaware that adding this would cause it to overdry and bend. Although it initially met our rigidity needs, it continued to dry, causing the edges to lift, failing to achieve the desired flat effect.
- In our second attempt, we added glycerol and covered it to prevent rising during drying, but this led to mold formation due to the biomaterials being covered. 
- Despite the limited mold formation on one side, we proceeded as the texture met our requirements. To hang it correctly, we glued the material to acrylic scraps to maintain rigidity (the material did not complety dry so it was a bit fragile), then hung it.

 *Feelings:* 

 - We were disappointed to have to try twice and found that the mistakes were quite common. Firstly, we simply forgot to add glycerol in the first attempt, and in the second, we didn't anticipate that covering the biomaterial and depriving it of air would lead to mold growth, especially since it was in contact with an improperly sealed piece.
 - Additionally, we felt bad because we had to use acrylic for drying the gelatine, which is an expensive material, and that didn't sit well with us since our product had no functional value.

 *Findings:* 
- I've acquired skills in laser cutting and creating biomaterials. 
- I've come to understand that biomaterial recipes are straightforward, yet achieving the desired strength and texture takes time. 
- It's important to reflect on how to maximize material usage in projects.

 *Future:* 
 - The initial try at producing a biomaterial is never final. Therefore, it's advisable to experiment on a small scale beforehand, testing various textures, colors, and drying durations, before settling on the ultimate material.
