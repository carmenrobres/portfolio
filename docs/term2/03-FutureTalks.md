## Design with Values

###  Contents
During this talk, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Distributed Design and designing with values. Since the beginning of the master's program, we've been exploring new ways of designing with fresh perspectives for emerging futures and learning about new technologies and mediums for innovation. However, after a trimester, I feel I've lost some sense of direction regarding whom we are designing for and with whom we are designing. This conference on Distributed Design and designing with values has allowed me to step back and view my project from an external perspective. I've realized that my projects in the first trimester were primarily focused on the concept of identity and were therefore quite egocentric. Moving forward, I may need to develop projects that prioritize mental health and identity but decentralize this concept not only in a European context but also aim to be socially sustainable and responsible.

While it may be challenging to maintain sustainable consciousness, considering my project ultimately revolves around artificial intelligence technologies, I aim to prioritize humanism and equity concepts. Therefore, I aspire to pursue ethical and equitable innovation.

###  Reflections

**- What are the key takeaways from the activity?**

During the presentation, we learned about the Distributed Design Platform called Reflection Tree. Essentially, it's a tool that helps you review your own projects and practices. I used this tool to evaluate a project I worked on in the first trimester, which was about digital identity and artificial intelligence. Clearly, this project was more about my personal exploration into AI and identity. I didn't expect it to impact society but rather to affect my own understanding and approach to the topic. Using this tool made me realize that my previous projects related to AI and identity have been quite self-centered and subjective. I may need to reconsider how I approach my projects. While it's challenging to connect AI to sustainability, I could strive to make my projects more open and collaborative. For instance, if I develop technology to enhance societal identity, it should be accessible to everyone. Additionally, discussions on mental health identity could involve collaboration with diverse communities and embrace regenerative practices and inclusion.

**- Reflection-Tree?**

Besides this, I find this tool quite useful, but it's somewhat subjective. I believe if someone who worked on the same project with me were to evaluate these values, they might think differently. Therefore, it's challenging to measure all these values objectively. However, it's a great tool for self-reflection and to determine the values we are truly applying. As designers, we often focus so much on solving problems that we sometimes forget who we are designing for and what our objectives are. This tool has helped me reevaluate that ultimately, the projects I undertake are meant to help others, not just to prove something.

Additionally, I think this tool is extensive and should be focused on long-term projects. I evaluated a project that lasted only a week, so it was challenging to deeply analyze its values. It was more of a tool to aid my journey as a designer in the master's program rather than a project with significant impact. Therefore, it would be better to apply this tool to the master's thesis rather than the smaller projects we've been doing throughout the course.
