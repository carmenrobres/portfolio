### Golden Circle
**Why:**
My  goal is to encourage deep thinking and discussions about the ethical impacts of blending transhumanism with technology. I aim to keep human values and identity intact while embracing technological progress. My fundamental belief is in the importance of safeguarding the unique essence, identity and mental health of humanity amid the swift advancements in technology.

**How:**
I plan to achieve this by collaborating across different disciplines, using creative design methods, and engaging with various social and cultural aspects. Through immersive experiences, seek to challenge perceptions and encourage self-reflection. My methodology involves integrating design thinking, ethical exploration, and technological innovation to develop interventions that spark critical thinking and emphasize ethical considerations.

**What:**
My work will result in the creation of immersive installations, interactive experiences, and thought-provoking artifacts. These creations will prompt conversations and contemplation on the intersection of humanity and technology. Tangible outcomes include prototypes, exhibitions, and multimedia materials that act as catalysts for discussions and reflections on the future of human identity and mental health in our technology-driven world.

### Stakeholders

My project's focus on ethical reflection and societal impact makes me look for certain stakeholders that can help me catalyze meaningful conversations and considerations surrounding transhumanism and technology. By engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, I can ensure a holistic approach to addressing the complex challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of technology into human identity and experience.

At this stage, I believe that stakeholders crucial to developing my project are from academia, government, and industry. This is primarily because I rely on the technological industry for insights and advancements to apply to my project. Academia will assist in conceptualizing the topic, while the government's involvement is essential for drawing conclusions on policies needed to sustain humanity amidst technological progress. If the project gains more clarity and becomes executable, involving media and broader communities would be straightforward. However, given the broad scope of applying technology to humanism, expanding it to specific communities seems challenging for now. Fundamentally, my focus lies not in engaging with specific organizations on cultural and civic concepts but in drawing inspiration from them to comprehend humanity's essence and preservation. Currently, the project lacks significant economic objectives, thus investor engagement is a potential future step. I believe my stakeholders will evolve and change as I delve deeper into this project.
