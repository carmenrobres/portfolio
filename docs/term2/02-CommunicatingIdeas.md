## Class 16th January: Storytelling

### Golden Circle
**Why:**
My  goal is to encourage deep thinking and discussions about the ethical impacts of blending transhumanism with technology. I aim to keep human values and identity intact while embracing technological progress. My fundamental belief is in the importance of safeguarding the unique essence, identity and mental health of humanity amid the swift advancements in technology.

**How:**
I plan to achieve this by collaborating across different disciplines, using creative design methods, and engaging with various social and cultural aspects. Through immersive experiences, seek to challenge perceptions and encourage self-reflection. My methodology involves integrating design thinking, ethical exploration, and technological innovation to develop interventions that spark critical thinking and emphasize ethical considerations.

**What:**
My work will result in the creation of immersive installations, interactive experiences, and thought-provoking artifacts. These creations will prompt conversations and contemplation on the intersection of humanity and technology. Tangible outcomes include prototypes, exhibitions, and multimedia materials that act as catalysts for discussions and reflections on the future of human identity and mental health in our technology-driven world.

### Stakeholders
![](../../images\term2\CommunicatingIdeas\StakeHolders 1.png){style: width="480", align=right}
My project's focus on ethical reflection and societal impact makes me look for certain stakeholders that can help me catalyze meaningful conversations and considerations surrounding transhumanism and technology. By engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, I can ensure a holistic approach to addressing the complex challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of technology into human identity and experience.

At this stage, I believe that stakeholders crucial to developing my project are from academia, government, and industry. This is primarily because I rely on the technological industry for insights and advancements to apply to my project. Academia will assist in conceptualizing the topic, while the government's involvement is essential for drawing conclusions on policies needed to sustain humanity amidst technological progress. If the project gains more clarity and becomes executable, involving media and broader communities would be straightforward. However, given the broad scope of applying technology to humanism, expanding it to specific communities seems challenging for now. Fundamentally, my focus lies not in engaging with specific organizations on cultural and civic concepts but in drawing inspiration from them to comprehend humanity's essence and preservation. Currently, the project lacks significant economic objectives, thus investor engagement is a potential future step. I believe my stakeholders will evolve and change as I delve deeper into this project.

## Class 30th January: Brand Persona

### Visual Workspace
During this course, we were introduced to a stakeholders radar tool, which allowed us to fill out a series of exercises based on the stakeholders identified in the previous class, in order to assess the tone, voice, and vision of my project. This tool is typically used for businesses to define the tone and communication strategy, in this case, the assignment required us to apply it to our project. It was a challenging task because these tools are primarily designed to determine the tone for selling a company, whereas my project aims to provoke reflection rather than simply sell a product or service. Therefore, translating this reflective tone into a tool primarily geared towards sales and marketing communication proved to be difficult. Here is a link where you can find all the tools provided, but from now on, I will provide further detail and develop some of them.

Firstly, before delving into the tone of voice of my project and how I want people to feel through it, it's important to clarify that my intentions are to declare the vision, which is essentially to create a future where technology can aid mental health and maintain people's individuality. Therefore, I aim to use and create ethical technology that prioritizes humans. My priority is to promote happiness while maintaining honesty and respect for the individual, and also to ensure that this technology allows us to be individuals while also connecting with the community.

### Tandem Project: Personality

**How will my project act?**

![](../../images\term2\CommunicatingIdeas\PErsonality.png){style: width="480", align=right}
When envisioning the persona of my project, I drew inspiration from the character Janet from the series "The Good Place." Much like Janet, an artificial intelligence embodied in human form, my project aims to offer comfort, support, and address various needs. Given its focus on mental health, I recognize the importance of maintaining a serious tone that respects the sensitivity of the issue.

While seriousness is essential, I also strive for an energetic tone that is easily digestible, capturing people's attention and engaging them in the subject matter. The goal is to encourage reflection on the intersection of mental health and technology, challenging conventional perceptions and fostering dialogue about the future.

Despite the project's focus on mental health, it's crucial to emphasize its altruistic intent. By aiming to create technology that genuinely improves mental well-being, the project stands as a beacon of progressiveness, inclusive of diverse individual needs.

Ultimately, my project serves as a bold reflection tool, prompting individuals to question society's current understanding of mental health and explore how technology can contribute to its enhancement. 

**How will my project talk?**

The tone of my project should embody honesty, proactivity, and a touch of sarcasm. The core idea revolves around developing technologies initially aimed at improving mental health. However, there's an underlying uncertainty about whether these innovations might pose future problems. Essentially, I want people to perceive the technologies I'm developing as beneficial for society while also questioning their long-term implications.

Consider, for instance, the use of a brain implant to alleviate depression. While it may appear promising at first glance, the potential risks associated with such invasive interventions cannot be overlooked. Thus, I aim for a tone that subtly challenges perceptions, prompting individuals to ponder the true nature of what I'm proposing â€“ whether it's ultimately advantageous or detrimental.

**How would you like your stakeholder to feel??**

When it comes to identifying an archetype for my project, it's a bit challenging as I resonate with various defined archetypes. Ultimately, I want people to connect with a project that is honest and simple yet fosters change and liberation for the community. Additionally, for this project to succeed, it requires originality and imagination. However, discussing the potential fears stemming from my project underscores the inherent complexity of technology. The fact that we all belong to the same community and use technology collectively can make us dependent and at risk of losing exclusivity. Furthermore, addressing the topic of mental health may also lead to specific isolation for each individual.

Similarly, if I had to choose a specific archetype, I would opt for the Innocent. Ultimately, what I aim for is to explore spirituality in a simple and honest manner, while utilizing technology, which is complex and can sometimes deceive.
