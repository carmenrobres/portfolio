### Soil
![](../images/DesignOthers/Soil.jpg){style: width="470", align=right}
On the first day of this seminar, we were introduced to the general concept of soil and land. Additionally, we began to theorize about designing in complex and entangled contexts. Designing for a community, even a small one, has ripple effects on a larger scale and has a long-term impact. "Every challenge assessed with sufficient perspective, becomes a wicked one." During the initial seminar day, we explored the Sants neighborhood, identifying aspects that could pose conflicts regarding the soil.
As we strolled through the streets, it became apparent that soil, encompassing land and ecologies beyond human communities, was scarce in the Sants neighborhood. Essentially, everything we encountered and observed was tailored for humans. This led us to reflect on the fact that, if you were something other than human, like an insect for example, the terrain resembled a desert and posed significant challenges. We pondered on the diverse textures of the soil, noting that it was poorly maintained with litter strewn about.
This prompted us to contemplate why the soil was neglected, why there was so much trash, and why the local society seemed content with maintaining this state. We delved into the repercussions on non-human species and explored ways to transform this neighborhood into a hub of biodiversity, not just for humans.<br><br>

### Land

Our visit to La Borda on the second day left a lasting impact. As the first cooperative housing in Spain built on land granted for use, it was a revelation, especially for someone like me who is from Barcelona and was previously unaware of La Borda. This experience led me to contemplate the nuances of designing for communities and the imperative of sustaining projects. It goes beyond merely contributing to a community; it involves understanding how to perpetuate the underlying philosophy and design principles over time. The visit also shed light on the integral role of politics in design and the often-overlooked possibilities within our reach.
Additionally, we delved back into the socio-ethnic aspects discussed on the first day of class, with a focus on the "land" component—everything from homes to creative spaces. This aspect offered me a fresh perspective on designing for others, even within our own human context. More than a technical learning experience for the master's program, it allowed me to explore different facets of Barcelona. It made me realize that, despite being a resident of this city, there is still much to learn, especially from these marvelous projects. They are already catalyzing positive societal changes, changes that deserve more attention and discussion.<br>

### Visits

From the recent visits, two main things have stuck with me. Firstly, we've been given a lot of resources over these weeks to continue designing beyond IAAC. It's been really helpful to have access to places like the Ateneu de Fabricació and manufacturing spaces, providing alternative resources if I want to keep using this machinery after the master's program ends. Secondly, there's the consideration of life after the master's. While the master's program is great for reflection and bringing about change from a unique designer's perspective, there's the lingering question of how these ideas apply in the professional world. How do we bring about change, earn a living, have a life, and still maintain these perspectives? Getting to know my master's community and potential future connections has given me a clearer vision of what might come after the master's. These are additional tools that can also be used in connection with this week's seminar on designing for others, entering designer communities, and bringing about change.<br><br><br>

### Conclusion of the project
I think it's essential to focus more on the reflective aspects of this project rather than its execution. The timeframe for completing this project was limited to just a week, which didn't allow us sufficient time to fully implement our planned activities. Additionally, having more theoretical knowledge, particularly on biodiversity, and establishing stronger connections with the planned communities would have been beneficial. It would have been valuable to learn more about their ongoing projects and explore potential solutions for promoting biodiversity in our society.

In an ideal scenario, executing the plan would have provided us with a deeper understanding of additional solutions for enhancing biodiversity and insight into the limitations the community may face in generating such solutions. Despite the project being completed swiftly, it was executed with precision, and our objectives were well-defined. Consequently, the clarity of our project documentation could potentially empower another community to read, comprehend, and initiate similar activities.

## Reflection
This seminar has helped me understand how to design for a community. It allowed me to perceive the city from a different perspective, viewing its issues and conflicts that we often overlook in our daily lives through different eyes. I also realized that creating solutions for a community involves engaging with and learning from that community. Contrary to the common approach where designers provide a solution, typically a product, to a community and then disengage, I've come to understand that this isn't necessarily the only way to solve a problem. Designing for a community means becoming an integral part of it, actively contributing to constant change, and not abandoning the community once the design phase is completed.

Moreover, this seminar has given me a new perspective on my city. While Barcelona has always seemed well-managed for humans, I now recognize, for the first time, that the city is exclusively designed for humans, lacking pathways for biodiversity and not fostering significant change. It also prompted reflection on the fact that solutions are often generated on a small scale, and this change can lead to conflicts in other spaces. Whenever crafting a solution or engaging in a project, it's crucial to map out your intentions, understand the communities involved, and assess the potential long and short-term impacts of the solution you're seeking.

**In conclusion, this seminar has been instrumental in helping me see things from a different viewpoint, grasp the overall picture of a problem, and understand its effects on others beyond the community I'm trying to interact with. It encourages going beyond and viewing things with different eyes, a different vision, and most importantly, actively participating with communities—not for the community but alongside them.**
