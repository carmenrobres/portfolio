# Machine Paradox
### Reflection Week 1: What is inside a microwave?
This class began with the thrilling challenge of taking apart an old electronic device, which in our case was an Orbegozo MI 2115 Microwave. We initially thought it would be fun to dismantle it, but as we started, we realized how difficult and risky it was due to the AC circuits and the capacitor. Still, we had a great time taking it apart, testing, and documenting every single piece of the microwave. I was lucky to have patient classmates around me who explained how everything worked.

Although I wish I could talk more about how we disassembled the microwave, its different parts, and the technicalities of the project, this first week of the Machine Paradox Seminar made me think a lot about my past college education. I have studied electronics, done lots of theoretical circuit calculations, but I didn't know much about the actual parts of the microwave or how they were used. I now understand that my degree was too theoretical and not at all practical. Despite memorizing various mathematical formulas and knowing how to do calculations with transistors, I had never actually built them in real life or seen one in person.

During this one-week activity, I learned more than in my entire college experience. Experiential learning helps you understand and learn better and faster. I never found the workings of a microwave interesting before, but now I find it fascinating. Its manufacturing and repair processes are so complex yet amazing. We were surprised to discover how all the components were intricately connected. If one component broke, it affected all the others connected to it, requiring fixing and rewiring. We also learned how to easily fix and re-operate components just by connecting them to a power source.

This week has inspired me to question how things work, and I'm eager to take apart everything I can get my hands on. My experience was only a small glimpse into how electronics function. Nonetheless, these initial steps helped me rethink and reconsider my approach to technology, paving the way for new experiments.
