### Reflection Week 1: What is inside a microwave?
This class began with the thrilling challenge of taking apart an old electronic device, which in our case was an Orbegozo MI 2115 Microwave. We initially thought it would be fun to dismantle it, but as we started, we realized how difficult and risky it was due to the AC circuits and the capacitor. Still, we had a great time taking it apart, testing, and documenting every single piece of the microwave. I was lucky to have patient classmates around me who explained how everything worked.

Although I wish I could talk more about how we disassembled the microwave, its different parts, and the technicalities of the project, this first week of the Machine Paradox Seminar made me think a lot about my past college education. I have studied electronics, done lots of theoretical circuit calculations, but I didn't know much about the actual parts of the microwave or how they were used. I now understand that my degree was too theoretical and not at all practical. Despite memorizing various mathematical formulas and knowing how to do calculations with transistors, I had never actually built them in real life or seen one in person.

During this one-week activity, I learned more than in my entire college experience. Experiential learning helps you understand and learn better and faster. I never found the workings of a microwave interesting before, but now I find it fascinating. Its manufacturing and repair processes are so complex yet amazing. We were surprised to discover how all the components were intricately connected. If one component broke, it affected all the others connected to it, requiring fixing and rewiring. We also learned how to easily fix and re-operate components just by connecting them to a power source.

**This week has inspired me to question how things work, and I'm eager to take apart everything I can get my hands on. My experience was only a small glimpse into how electronics function. Nonetheless, these initial steps helped me rethink and reconsider my approach to technology, paving the way for new experiments.**

### Reflection Week 2
During the last week, our team has been focused on creating an almost useful machine with a specific purpose: to cool down food using parts we salvaged from our previous microwave project. We started our work with careful planning, and then we printed and put together the machine's parts. We used  technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting prioritizing the refinement of intricate details within the machine rather than the complete structural overhaul. **As our project progressed, we faced some challenges, such as issues with the quality of our prints because we only measured things once, leading to mistakes in the production process.**

To address these challenges, we made modifications to the machine's casings and added extra elements that made the machine more useless. This decision was influenced by the perception that the machine was too practical (as it could serve a legitimate need to cool down food), leading us to incorporate additional features to make it less functional. Consequently, we developed a system that allowed the machine to respond to specific actions, such as weight and movement. Once triggered, the machine would emit an annoying sound and cool down your food at the same time. To enhance users' understanding of the machine's functionality, we integrated printed designs and LED lights, making it more user-friendly. Our project culminated in the final assembly of the machine and the creation of a themed video inspired by Wes Anderson, emphasizing the contrast between the machine's potential to induce stress and its actual usefulness.

### Learning Goals and Applications
Initially, **transforming a previously functional machine into an almost useful one might appear futile. Yet, it has encouraged me to adopt a more comprehensive outlook.** It not only urges me to question the reasons behind a machine's breakdown but also prompts me to contemplate the entire life cycle of technology. Can we uncover value in what others regard as mere waste? This process has fundamentally altered my view of technology, demonstrating how a discarded machine can be salvaged, repurposed, and transformed into something fresh and purposeful, rather than just contributing to the ever-growing pile of discarded items.

This project has been a captivating journey, where the blend of enjoyment and learning has played a crucial role. The creation of the machine, though not entirely functional, has sparked my intuition and drive for perfection, serving as a thrilling learning experience. Collaborating with my peers, engaging in stimulating discussions, and collectively devising effective strategies has been an invaluable experience. The inclusive nature of our teamwork was particularly invigorating, with each member making significant contributions to the project's success.

**It has ignited in me a renewed enthusiasm and a desire to delve deeper into the world of machines and electronic components.** I eagerly anticipate the chance to disassemble an old, unused phone, exploring its internal mechanisms and considering opportunities for recycling and reusing its components. While recycling is commonly discussed, the idea of repurposing electronic products is often overlooked. My deeper understanding of technology's inner workings has kindled a curiosity that compels me to ask more questions and explore my surroundings with heightened inquisitiveness. **This project has not only been a source of inspiration but has also acted as a catalyst for ongoing learning and innovation in the field of technology.**
