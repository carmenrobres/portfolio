# Documenting Design
### Designing my website

Creating my first website has been quite the journey. It's been a challenge for several reasons. First, I've never used GitHub before, and second, my background is in graphic design. I have a strong desire to make my website beautiful, visually appealing, and aligned with my design sensibilities.To tackle this, I began by designing my initial draft in Figma. However, as I delved into coding it myself, I quickly realized the complexities of web development. I've had to adapt my design to match my coding skills. This means making adjustments and rethinking how I approach certain elements.

I've even experimented with different tools. For instance, I considered using Mobirise instead of MKDocs. However, I found that Mobirise uses a template that doesn't quite align with my design preferences. So, I've chosen to stick with coding my website from scratch, allowing me the freedom to refine it and make it better as I progress.

It's not always easy, and there are moments when I feel like revamping everything because I believe my website looks too basic. Nevertheless, I believe this approach is the right choice. It allows me to adapt and evolve my design as I improve my coding skills. Hopefully, one day, my website will perfectly mirror what I envisioned in Figma and represent me to the fullest extent.

### My way of communicating

With the first class of the Documenting Design Seminar, I now understand how important documentation is, especially given my past experience with a lack of guidance on the subject. All of my previous projects were not documented correctly, so now I have no information about the process and my thoughts on those projects. Itâ€™s great that I now have this platform to document my work, even though it can be challenging to balance living in the moment and capturing information. I want to listen, understand, and learn, but at the same time, I need to record and take pictures. From now on, I'm going to be focused on finding a rhythm that allows me to both immerse myself in the experience and record important details.

On the other hand, I am incredibly excited to embark on my journey through my Master's program, and I'm particularly thrilled about the prospect of documenting this experience. Throughout my academic and professional life, I've come to realize that words may not be my strongest suit. I tend to over-explain or lack the straightforwardness I desire in my communication. 

To address this, I've set a personal goal for myself: to create unique posters for each seminar. Instead of relying solely on written text that may not fully capture what I want to convey, I want to present my ideas visually. I am eager to construct a narrative throughout my Master's journey, using visual elements to tell my story and communicate my understanding of the material. This endeavor excites me as it allows me to find my unique voice and method of expression, one that aligns more closely with my strengths and preferences.

Right now, I'm wondering: What style defines me? Which fonts truly represent who I am? What about colors? How can I describe my brand?

I guess we'll find out together.
