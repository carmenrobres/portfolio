## Week 1 Reflection
![](../images/biozero/BIOLAB.svg){style: width="470", align=right}
This seminar has been a fulfilling experience for me, despite not having a prior passion for biology. Delving into the fundamentals of biology and exploring topics aligned with my interests, particularly in sustainability, has been enlightening. While the seminar leaned towards theory rather than practical applications, the wealth of information received justified the approach. I discovered intriguing facets of biology, from cultivating spirulina to comprehending the intricacies of how a body works. The discussion around CRISPR-Cas caught my interest, and it's surprising that it's not a more commonly discussed topic.

Additionally, the seminar addressed the profound impact of climate change on various aspects of our lives, from online searches to dietary habits, revealing prevalent misinformation. This realization has sparked my passion and inspiration. While we often talk about futuristic discoveries, the truth is that the future is now, and innovations are already underway. Scientists have devised solutions to pressing issues, with the primary challenge lying in societal awareness. This seminar has been instrumental in helping me understand this crucial point.

**What stood out to me beyond the technical aspects was a profound reflection on how we can assist scientists in effectively communicating their knowledge to today's society. Nuria's emphasis on questioning information is timely, considering the diminishing engagement with scientific literature and renowned figures in the age of platforms like TikTok. Her contemplation on bridging this communication gap between scientists and the wider public is both insightful and thought-provoking.**
