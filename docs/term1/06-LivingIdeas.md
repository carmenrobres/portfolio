# Living With Your Own Ideas
## My companion: Adrift from independence
![](../images/LOI/barco.svg){align=right}
For this project, we were asked to create a model that represented a specific feeling or theme. In this case, I chose the feeling of independence because I relate it to my experience of living alone for a long time, away from my family. Although I sometimes consider myself an independent person, I also rely heavily on the people around me and my friends. For example, when I am sick, I need someone to come to my house to take care of me.

I decided to represent my concept of independence through a model that symbolizes a boat. In this boat, I had control and carried my own flag and sail. Additionally, I incorporated an egg carton with four compartments that symbolized the four pillars of a person: the self, family, friends, and partner. My goal with the model was to add weight throughout the day to the compartments where I interacted. For example, if I spent time with my friends, I would place marbles in the friends' compartment. Similarly, if I dedicated time to myself, I would place marbles in the self-compartment, and so on with the family and partner.

In my experiment, I tried to make the boat float, understanding that independence involves finding a stable balance between self-care and relationships with friends, a partner, and family. However, I noticed that by spending a lot of time with my friends, the space designated for friendship became so full that it started to encroach on other spaces, such as the family space. Also, by placing my friends and "self" on one side of the boat and the partner and family on the other, the boat constantly tipped to the left, given that I do not live with my family and do not have a partner. Over time, the boat sank, not only due to the excess weight and poor distribution of the pillars but also because the corks I had placed at the base to make it float came off. This observation led me to reflect on whether I truly am independent and if my concept of independence is misconstrued, which would imply that my boat sank because I did not build it properly. Maybe I don't need all the pilars to be independent. To make the boat float you just need balance but it will always tilt, a boat is never still. So independence should be the same, an continous journey of finding balance in your life and drive the boat of life with you as the captain.

## Living with Ideas: My exploration


· What did you make? And why did it matter?
• What happens when you involve yourself?
• What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?
• Did anything change about your way of working?
• What does it mean for your future work?
• After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how
does it change your understanding of it, present new
opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?
