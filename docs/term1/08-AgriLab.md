## Reflection
![](../images/Term1/agri/AGRI.svg){style: width="470", align=right}
**In reality, agriculture has never been a passion for me. I am one of those people who have even managed to kill a cactus, and I am clear that, in the event of an apocalypse, I would not survive due to my lack of skills to live off nature. However, this seminar has represented a valuable opportunity for me to acquire basic knowledge about agriculture, despite my lack of previous experience.**

What impacted me most positively was the practical experience of creating our own garden, something I considered much more exciting compared to conventional theoretical classes. Although I was sick during the seminar, limiting my participation and theoretical learning, the visit to Valldaura was extraordinary. The community and the possibility of living outside the city appealed to me, even though I realize that I would not be able to commit to living in that way for a whole year. Reflecting on my theoretical knowledge in agriculture, I believe I do not like it as much because I have not experienced it firsthand in a community committed to that lifestyle. I consider that, if I were surrounded by people who value and want to learn more about agriculture, I could better appreciate and take advantage of the experience.

The most striking thing that this seminar left me with was the reflection on the remuneration of jobs in agriculture. I realized that the most difficult and essential jobs for our society are generally the worst paid. Agriculture involves hard work to cultivate and maintain a garden, and the compensation does not always reflect the importance of their work, considering that many people depend on those products for sustenance.

**Furthermore, the class discussion on large-scale agriculture made me understand that, to achieve a more sustainable world, we must begin to do things on a smaller scale. Gardens should be sustained by the community and, therefore, by the people who work daily in them. This idea of smaller scales also leads me to think about how technology could be integrated to make work in a small community, like Valldaura with its 25 inhabitants, less exhausting and more sustainable. In summary, my experience in the Agriculture seminar has not only provided me with knowledge about food cultivation but has also left me with a deep reflection on the valuation of essential jobs and the need to seek sustainable solutions on a smaller scale.**

>I was mostly sick during this seminar so I missed out on a lot. If you don't want to get FOMO like me, watch Nicol√≤'s video :)
