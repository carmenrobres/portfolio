# Landing

October 8th
As I step into this new phase of my education and career journey, I can't help but feel excited about the fresh changes and opportunities ahead. Every day, I'm gaining a lot of new knowledge, which reminds me why I decided to pursue this master's degree in the first place. Meeting fellow students and educators this week has been truly inspiring, and I believe we're all set for an enriching journey where we'll learn and grow together as a class and comunity.

Yet, amidst this external adventure, I'm also dealing with a personal challenge. I've come to realize that if I want to make a positive impact on the world, I first need to confront my own biases, habits, and thoughts that have been shaped by society and my upbringing. My biggest struggle right now is with myself. I aspire to open my mind to new information and fresh ways of thinking and creating, but I must overcome self-doubt as a starting point. This week, we've delved into the concept of transhackfeminism, decolonizing technologies and also talked about the fact designers should draw from personal experiences to design for the future. However, my mind is still filled with questions like: Am I capable enough for this master's program? Can I actively contribute to class discussions and add value to our group? Will I be able to grasp everything they're teaching us? 
Nevertheless, every day in class, I learn new things from my classmates, and it's evident that all of us share some level of insecurity regarding the master's program. While we're enthusiastic about the journey, we're still figuring out how to contribute our knowledge effectively.

To sum it up, this week has taught me that my journey won't be a perfect, straightforward path; there will be plenty of mistakes along the way as I learn and grow. I'm actively working on becoming more open-minded, creative, and adept at expressing my ideas clearly while exploring various subjects. My primary goal remains making a positive impact, and although I have a general direction in mind, I'm open to discovering new interests and possibilities along the way.
