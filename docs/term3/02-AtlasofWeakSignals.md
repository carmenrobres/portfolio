## Reflection
![](../../images\term3\Atlas\foto.jpg){style: width="480", align=right}
It was fascinating to be part of this activity, as it felt like a kind of pause from the fast pace of the master's program. For the first time, we were doing something to help others instead of constantly absorbing information from our professors. This was a moment where we shared our knowledge to collectively create something. It was also interesting for me to step outside the realm of mental health and identity and explore more technology-related issues, which still play a part in my master's thesis, but aren't exactly the main focus. Using this methodology was quite enlightening as it was well-mapped for brainstorming, and I believe it's a valuable exercise, meticulously structured. However, creating these weak signals was challenging for me, as I still struggle to grasp the concept itself. Given that these topics are likely to change annually, it's difficult to discern which themes are currently weak signals that could potentially develop. Nonetheless, I found it very intriguing, and I would love to see which of the generated cards end up being part of the deck. Additionally, the interactive exercise was engaging, and I definitely look forward to using such brainstorming structures to create different projects in the future.
