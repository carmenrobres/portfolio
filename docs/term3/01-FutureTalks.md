During our conference, we were taken on a tour of Hospitalet, where we explored various artistic and design communities. We also gained insights into the city's culture and its lesser-known aspects. It was fascinating to learn about Hospitalet's cultural concept as a highly communal city where residents support each other and keep certain spaces secret to prevent rent hikes within the community.

Additionally, Saúl shared his projects with us, showcasing his work at Does Work and Maybe Asap. He also presented his magazine and advertising campaign, providing insight into his projects related to technology and identity. Beyond the projects themselves, Saúl's ethical approach to magazine ownership and his innovative marketing strategies, including TikTok campaigns, left a lasting impression on us.


###  Reflections
####  Reflection on the Talk

Personally, I found the conference with Saúl fascinating both on a personal and professional level. On one hand, I was introduced to a tour of Hospitalet, a city I've always visited without questioning its cultural or structural aspects. Therefore, seeing this perspective of Hospitalet was very interesting for me. 
On the other hand, Saúl's presentation of his projects and his way of viewing and communicating things intrigued me, as his research topic is very similar to mine. Ultimately, Saúl explores identity in technology and how to safeguard our privacy by hacking technology to protect our biometric data. I found his approach of exploring things freely while prioritizing our privacy very compelling. I appreciated that he had clear ideas because specifying my master's thesis topic has been challenging for me. Saúl managed to take a specific topic, such as biometrics, analyze it, and expand it in different aspects. His way of arguing and communicating complex topics was very interesting to me. He didn't impose his ideas on us; instead, he simply explained them, allowing us to form our own opinions. **I found his artistic and creative way of expressing complex projects inspiring, and he provided many insights into managing one's own projects, including the lessons learned from mistakes.** I've been researching and observing his work for a long time, so finally meeting him felt like meeting a very interesting, honest person who is eager to help. Therefore, I look forward to further exploring this path and continuing to communicate with him to expand my knowledge and my way of expressing myself in my thesis on the connection between identity, social networks, mental health, and technology.

####  Reflection on my thesis
The reflection I've drawn from Saúl is that I essentially need to find my theme to explore this concept of identity and technology. Among all the aspects of identity that one can measure, Saúl has chosen the concept of biometrics and has been trying to create a language that technology can understand about ourselves and our identity. I believe my thesis topic relates to this, but I need to pinpoint this concept to explore. For me, I've always been interested in mental health, but I find this battle against data and surveillance capitalism, trying to safeguard our data and identity from being sold, much more intriguing than having our mental health tech. Therefore, perhaps from this conversation, instead of constantly trying to generate mental health technologies and products, **I might want to step back and first explore how this technology can understand us better, and then, likely, explore creating products for mental health.** Obviously, I need to figure out how this technology can understand me and what element I want the technology to grasp. Saúl has explored the concept of biometrics, **but there are many more things about us that define us and that technology could read, such as the photos on our phones, our chats, our movements, our ethnicity, the music we like, among many other things, and these are data that are still being sold to different companies, so it's also interesting to explore how to use this data to understand a person without exploiting or selling it.**
