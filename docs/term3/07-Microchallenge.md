### Repository
For this week, we decided to combine two projects that had originated from the first microchallenge, where Ana had a representation of abuse throught tech devices, and I had the anxiety necklaces that I explained in the first microchallenge. Essentially, what we did was, in order to join forces, we wanted to create a graphic representation of what health is, specifically mental health regarding anxiety, and physical health regarding abuse. Our research on understanding and making devices that could collect data and reprocess it in order to create an artistic artifact that is a mapping of these.
