## Embodying Surveillance
> 7th - 10th of May 

> Anna Fedele and Carmen Robres
### Repository
For this week, we decided to combine two projects that had originated from the first microchallenge, where Ana had a representation of abuse throught tech devices, and I had the anxiety necklaces that I explained in the first microchallenge. Essentially, what we did was, in order to join forces, we wanted to create a graphic representation of what health is, specifically mental health regarding anxiety, and physical health regarding abuse. Our research on understanding and making devices that could collect data and reprocess it in order to create an artistic artifact that is a mapping of these.

### Reflection

**This week's project has been a culmination of my coursework for the year, allowing me to integrate all the techniques I've been exploring. From delving into Arduino and refining its applications to crafting a wearable piece, experimenting with code to communicate across various devices, and creating visual representations of emotional dynamics – this microchallenge has been instrumental in consolidating my learning journey.**

In particular, it's provided a platform to delve into the core themes of my master's program: the intersection of technology as a reflective tool and the pervasive nature of capitalist surveillance. Exploring tools like Machine Learning has underscored the biases inherent in data collection and analysis, while grappling with the complexities of creating accurate datasets has been eye-opening.

**Moreover, this project marks a significant milestone in my skill development. From Python programming to training a machine learning model for the first time, from crafting wearables with innovative fabric choices to navigating TouchDesigner's interface – each step has been a leap into new territory.**

While this microchallenge isn't the final iteration for MDFest, it's a promising precursor. The overarching aim remains to create interactive systems that react to human input, leveraging camera data and other sensory cues to generate artistic expressions and critique the surveillance structures underpinning our society.

**Reflecting on this experience, I recognize areas for improvement, especially in streamlining the connectivity of multiple elements to ensure seamless functionality. Yet, overall, I'm pleased with the progress made and the depth of understanding gained, affirming my commitment to exploring technology's transformative potential within a critical framework.**
