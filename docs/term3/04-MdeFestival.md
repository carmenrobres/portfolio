## Reflection
It has been quite challenging to navigate this course, especially since organizing a project without a clear topic was difficult. I literally changed my topic when we started this course, so communicating and reaching agreements with others without a clear direction was tough. It's been a complex journey, but I believe we now have a good starting point: to explore the intersection of identity and technology, whether through performance or embodiments, and to foster reflection rather than creating problem-solving products. Over the past month, I've changed my mind 25 times, making it challenging to organize how to approach the festival properly. Additionally, finding a suitable venue is a major concern for me. However, I hope to start securing spaces soon as I'm making more contacts, which should make it easier to find venues that allow us to host the event for free.
