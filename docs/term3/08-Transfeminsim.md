## Reflection
This class has been very interesting for my studies on identity and technology. We delved into the historical and philosophical aspects of the body, which have greatly shaped our understanding of identity. Exploring how the body has been stigmatized in the past and viewed mechanistically, alongside the emergence of phenomenology, laid a solid groundwork for grasping the significance of our physical presence in defining who we are.

The discussions on how societal structures and power dynamics influence our identities were particularly captivating. They underscored the enduring importance of the body in identity formation, even in the digital era. These insights revealed that while technology enables us to maintain dual identities in both the digital and physical realms, our bodies remain integral to our sense of self and aspirations.

The idea of humans as hybrids of machine and organism struck a chord with me, especially concerning my project's focus on the intersection of identity and technology. Furthermore, examining how various forms of discrimination intersect and impact our identities deepened my understanding of these complex issues.

The field trip to Hangar was a definite highlight, providing valuable insights into how these theories manifest in contemporary art and society. Overall, this class has reinforced the notion that while we navigate dual identities in the digital and physical worlds, our bodies remain at the core of our identity and aspirations. This holistic perspective has greatly enriched my project, offering a more comprehensive and meaningful exploration of identity in the digital age.
