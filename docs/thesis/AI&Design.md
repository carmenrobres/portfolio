## My thesis
### Exploring the Integration of Artificial Intelligence into Community Makerspaces to Democratize Design and Fabrication

### Abstract 
This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into design and fabrication within local makerspaces in Barcelona. With AI quickly becoming a bigger part of our everyday lives, this project looks at whether these powerful tools, usually used to speed up production and benefit big companies, can instead be used to support local communities and give people more control over how things are designed and made. The central question guiding this work is: How can artificial intelligence be introduced and potentially integrated into community makerspaces to have easier access to design and fabrication without compromising ethical, educational, and collaborative values?
Drawing from design theory and speculative frameworks, the project examines the role AI could and should play in a makerspace. Through conversations with professionals, educators, and technologists, and through hands-on experimentation with existing AI tools, the project develops a working hypothesis through three key phases:  (1) the formulation of a manifesto outlining AI’s role in local design contexts; (2) the implementation of teaching strategies through workshops and public talks; and (3) the evaluation and development of accessible tooling for non-expert users. The research also raises important questions about what problems AI is truly solving. Is it strengthening how we work together in communities, or simply making us more reliant on quick, automated solutions? In the end, the research compiles practical feedback from field activities and suggests that while AI can be a useful tool, its real value depends on how it’s introduced, alongside strong community values, and with a clear focus on keeping people, collaboration, and creativity at the heart of the making process.
