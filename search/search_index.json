Although many of us shared an interest in repurposing waste and agreed that waste doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something worthless, our understanding of materials and waste was quite disorganized. We all acknowledged the need for a mindset shift towards recycling at home, and recognized the lack of awareness about waste management practices. We especially pondered the stark contrast in the availability of recycling bins in Barcelona compared to other European countries. Additionally, we emphasized the value and potential reuse of waste materials, sparking discussions about alternative material applications.</p> <p>While our collective understanding was generally aligned, each of us had specific focal points; some were solely interested in coffee, others in materials affecting the ocean, and some in plastics. Consequently, it was challenging to concentrate the Design Space\u2019s focus on a single material for our workshop, which was initially intended to demonstrate how to repurpose waste and generate new materials.</p> <p>Despite the complexities, engaging in the Design Space group was an enjoyable experience. We shared various articles and recommended different resources to each other, fostering a collaborative environment for expanding our knowledge. Moreover, this exchange allowed us to discover other projects and topics of interest among our classmates, which we could also integrate into our own Design Space.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#reflection-of-our-group-work","title":"Reflection of our group work","text":"<p> At first, we were very excited about setting up a workshop that focused on finding new ways to reuse our domestic waste. We were especially interested in exploring how to make new things from organic materials. We started the project with a lot of enthusiasm but didn\u2019t look into the best ways to actually repurpose these materials or what others had already figured out. This meant we didn\u2019t realize there was an extensive reservoir of untapped knowledge and resources available on the subject of repurposing waste materials, be it organic or synthetic.</p> <p>When we tried to put this knowledge into practice, we ran into some unexpected problems. ot only did we struggle to enjoy the process, but we also realized that our approach lacked a comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of waste management and sustainable practices. This made us take a step back and rethink about what we originally wanted to achieve. We started to wonder if what we were doing was actually helping.</p> <p>Consequently, we decided to try a different approach by creating an interactive survey as an intervention. We encouraged participants to reflect on their personal definitions of waste and their daily waste management habits, we sought to foster a deeper understanding of the underlying attitudes and perspectives driving individual actions. The survey showed us that people have different ideas about how to manage waste. Some think that repurposing things is a key part of recycling, while others aren\u2019t as sure and think we need to teach more about how to handle waste properly.</p> <p>This experience has solidified my belief that not everything falls solely on the individual\u2019s responsibility. There is a need for legislative changes and government and community involvement, as well as the creation of accessible pathways for people to adopt sustainable practices and for cities to become more environmentally friendly. Therefore, it\u2019s not just about conducting workshops on how to recycle materials, as this information already exists. The issue lies in the execution, which is hindered by the community and the current governmental structure.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#personal-design-space-updated","title":"Personal Design Space updated","text":"<p>Personally, I enjoyed this activity, but I\u2019ve realized as a designer that my goal of creating change has shifted. I now understand that materials already exist, solutions are in place, and technologies are available. What\u2019s needed is a specific focus and a societal shift. This involves changing our mindset, making sustainable choices easier, and ensuring recycling becomes a simple task. This intervention has made me aware that sustainability will always be a part of my life and remain a priority. However, as a designer, my interest has evolved. It\u2019s no longer about solely creating new materials or solving all the world\u2019s problems. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll always consider when crafting objects and generating new ideas, but it\u2019s no longer my primary focus or dedicated pursuit.</p> <p>Similarly, having reached this conclusion through this intervention, my question now is, what is my main interest as a designer? It\u2019s a challenging question to answer because I believe sustainability will always be at the heart of my work as a product designer. However, after starting this master\u2019s program, I\u2019ve come to realize that my interests extend beyond just the product itself to my personal inclinations. One area I\u2019ve yet to explore in my design space is my passion for food, which can also be tied to sustainability. I\u2019m also keenly interested in mental health, equality, and technology. I feel a strong inclination towards exploring mental well-being and would like to delve deeper into this area. Moreover, to make the most of my master\u2019s degree and to contemplate mental health in the future, I aim to utilize today\u2019s technologies to enhance the field of psychology.</p> <p>Furthermore, I want to focus on my identity and the identities of others, examining the implications of technology on a person\u2019s identity today. I am interested in understanding how this impacts our daily lives and how we have become reliant on technology. This decision has emerged from this intervention and a recent seminar that underscored my interest in exploring people\u2019s identities, their mental well-being, and their relationship with technology and dependency.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#my-new-design-space","title":"My new Design Space","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/","title":"Design Studio","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#roles-of-prototying","title":"Roles of Prototying","text":"<p> This was my first design studio class, and it was fascinating to discuss the different roles of prototyping and reflect on my own experiences with it. As an industrial design engineer, I have primarily engaged in role 1 prototyping. Initially, I perceived a prototype as a preliminary version of a functional object. To me, prototyping often involves navigating through frustrations, time constraints, and the pursuit of perfection.</p> <p>After the seminar, I became interested in roles 2 and 3. Role 2 focuses on gathering information and exploring new ideas, rather than just creating functional objects. This type of prototyping involves learning and collaborating with others. On the other hand, role 3, to me, feels like art \u2014 a way to encourage people to think about our society and learn from it. I realized that when I draw, paint, or work with ceramics, I\u2019m essentially creating prototypes that represent issues in our society.</p> <p>Though I find it challenging to implement role 4 in my current context, I am intrigued by its unique approach to prototyping. It appears to be an exciting and unconventional method that fosters discovery and collaboration through co-design and participatory design processes.</p> <p>Here are some examples of my prototyping experiences:</p> <p>Role 1: Redesign and prototyping of sustainable pulp paper corners for ROS furniture. The project aimed to protect furniture sides while promoting the use of eco-friendly materials in transportation. Despite the need for additional time and specialized tools for precise cutting, it offered efficient and user-friendly protection.</p> <p>Role 2: \u201cCreate Your Own Coffee Machine\u201d project. Our goal was to understand user preferences for a coffee machine. Through providing different button options and functionalities, we encouraged users to customize their ideal coffee machine.</p> <p>Role 3: Exploring art as a means of societal reflection.</p> <p>Role 4: Participation in the Spaghetti Tower Challenge.</p> <p>In the end, I\u2019ve realized just how important prototypes are in the whole process of creating something, even if they\u2019re not perfect. My recent realization has really made me curious about exploring prototyping in a new way, not just to make a final thing, but to learn and improve the whole process of creating something. I\u2019m eager to dive deeper into how prototyping can help us learn, grow, and make our projects even more awesome.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#prototype","title":"Prototype","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#interseguro-vehicular-app","title":"Interseguro Vehicular App","text":"Carmen \u00b7 Prototype explanation"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#rtd-tool-box","title":"Rtd Tool box","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/031-PersonalNarratives/","title":"Personal Narratives","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/031-PersonalNarratives/#deliverable","title":"Deliverable","text":"<p>Individual </p> <p>The figure that a choose for a personal narrative was a blanket.

This became our Collective Design Space:  </p> <p>In this intervention, our primary goal was to prompt our classmates to engage in thoughtful introspection about their digital identity\u2014considering both how they are currently perceived by others and how they aspire to be perceived. Given that our generation has grown up in a digital era, our online presence has become an integral part of our personal identity. We\u2019ve become accustomed to presenting ourselves within the constraints of various platforms, often utilizing a combination of text and images. However, we posed a critical question: Is our Instagram account, or any other digital representation, an authentic reflection of who we truly are? To explore this, we collaborated with classmates, fostering a collective space where we encouraged them to reflect on their self-perception based on their online identity and the impressions that strangers made of them in the digital realm.</p> <p>In order to make that happened we did the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>We asked our classmates for permission to show their Instagram profiles to our friends.</li> <li>We created a survey with very specific and limited response questions in order to have the same model with everyone. The questions were such as: Identify this persons sexuality, origin, recycling habits, travelling habits and self-care practices.  </li> <li> <p>We shared the social media profiles and asked our friends to fill out forms about each profile. Each profile was looked at only one time, so each classmate only got one digital identity.

For instance, we overlooked a question, specifically one about political opinions derived from Instagram accounts, which we found particularly interesting. I also believe we should have granted more freedom to our friends in their judgment. Instead of providing limited options for certain questions, such as the number of books they read, we should have allowed more subjective responses. This would have avoided generating similar profiles, making users appear less diverse. It would have been better to let people judging these profiles respond with more subjective questions or give them the freedom to say what they wanted. For example, asking them to judge their interests, how they perceive that person, whether they think the person is cheerful, sad, energetic, calm, their zodiac sign, etc. This approach would have allowed for more creativity rather than creating rigid profiles.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this project, and I believe both we and our classmates had a good time. It proved to be a valuable exercise, as everyone appreciated gaining insights into how others perceive them based on their social media profiles. Many were intrigued to view their Instagram profiles from different perspectives.

Many believed that bot-written texts are short, formal, and impersonal, with repetitive tones, indicating artificiality. However, when given a prompt mimicking a particular author\u2019s style, the AI produced a different tone, further confusing respondents. Most associated artificial intelligence with impersonality, formality, and repetition. Regarding images, people thought imperfections/glitches indicated artificiality, focusing on details like poorly drawn hands or overly detailed images. Creativity was also seen as a marker of human origin, though we were the ones promoting creativity.

In this second intervention, it\u2019s been classmates and members of the FABLAB community who\u2019ve been instrumental in assisting me with creating these technologies. Consequently, I must acknowledge that, in terms of community responsibility, I haven\u2019t effectively applied the concept of community interaction. My projects have been overly dependent on my ability to develop the technologies I wish to use, thus limiting my engagement to just the FABLAB and MDEF community. Had I been able to create the necessary technologies when required, I could have interacted with a broader range of communities.</p> <p>Overall, I believe my thesis lacks a direct connection to non-human elements and is clearly focused on what is human and essential to our identity. Mental health, in particular, is a universal concern, as is our interaction with technology in our daily lives and how it impacts our identity and self-perception. Therefore, as a designer and in terms of community responsibility, I feel I still need to create this community. My goal is to establish it with individuals who can openly discuss mental health and who may have some form of mental health issue. Thus far, I believe that in the future, I will continue learning and researching how to create these technologies and the best ways to reach these communities. Once I\u2019ve acquired the necessary knowledge to drive my project forward, I\u2019ll attempt to connect with individuals who have mental health issues and who would be interested in using my technological products for mental health. In this case, they would likely be friends and family, as I believe this topic requires a level of trust and openness to discuss.

In the first intervention, I delved into understanding artificial intelligence and its potential application in decoding human identity and language. Subsequently, I utilized AI to understand the workings of various technologies and how to develop an element that aids in mental health improvement. Now, in this third intervention, my focus shifts to understanding the brain itself.</p> <p>Essentially, if my goal is to \u201chack\u201d the brain, how do scientists comprehend mental health and trauma, enabling me to understand it better? In this regard, I conducted an interview with a friend, In\u00e9s, who is an epigenetics scientist specializing in researching trauma and mental health.

Your parents faced challenges and had to adapt, so they want to set you up with the best tools to survive in this world.

While researchers and scientists are beginning to comprehend our brains and generational trauma, there are numerous ethical implications regarding this type of research that still require reflection. Do we truly want to alter our epigenetics to reduce the trauma inherited across generations? Is combating generational trauma comparable to battling cancer, or does it risk compromising our human experience and resilience?  We must be careful in contemplating the intersection of technology and mental health, as ultimately, we are fighting with the essence of our own nature.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term2/05-DesignDialogues/","title":"Design Dialogues","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term2/05-DesignDialogues/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>The Design Dialogues served as a pivotal moment for me to hone in on the focus of my research.

Today, privacy laws have improved, and by law, all platforms must allow you to download all the data they\u2019ve accumulated about you. In this case, I downloaded a year\u2019s worth of data from Instagram and received a ZIP folder containing all the information.</p> <p>From my prior research, I expected Instagram to have information such as my gender, age, location, the type of phone I use, all the images I\u2019ve posted, liked, and interacted with. However, two specific aspects were particularly interesting. Firstly, there was a folder called Preferences, which listed topics that supposedly interest me. Amusingly, one of these was Gym Workouts, which I\u2019ve never looked up, along with categories like mammals, animals, and pets. Despite these predictions, they don\u2019t align with my actual interests.</p> <p>Another folder contained my personal information, including my gender, age, autofill information, credit card details, and passwords\u2014sensitive data I wouldn\u2019t want Instagram to share.</p> <p></p> <p>The most important aspect for me was the topic of advertisements. My exploration focuses on how surveillance capitalism is used to influence our thoughts and actions. The Ads and Topics folder listed all the ads I\u2019ve seen, clicked on, and accounts deemed uninteresting to me. While it makes sense for Instagram to track interactions to optimize ad revenue, it raised concerns for me. For instance, how long must I view a post before it\u2019s categorized as interesting? How many seconds of interaction qualify as a like?</p> <p>More alarming was the Advertisement folder, which listed all the platforms and companies that have targeted me with ads. This included a list of advertisers, many of whom I couldn\u2019t identify. My initial thought was that these names might be encrypted to obscure the true companies behind them. However, after some googling, I discovered that many were individuals, not companies. This realization was unsettling, as it implied that behind Instagram, there are real people, not just companies, actively working to include me in their advertising campaigns and present ads to me for their benefit.</p> <p></p> <p>KEY TAKEAWAYS: This made me question many things, such as why ordinary people would want to appear in my Instagram feed. What images have they wanted to show me that I don\u2019t remember seeing? Or have they simply wanted to take my data for other purposes? This started to alarm me and also made me realize that during my exploration, I didn\u2019t mind Instagram having all this data about me or companies like Spotify or LinkedIn having my information. But once I saw the name of a person I didn\u2019t know on the advertiser list, I became concerned. So, in matters of privacy, we don\u2019t mind being monitored by platforms, but we do care when specific individuals know information about us. In other words, I don\u2019t mind if Google or Meta knows everything about me, but I do care if my neighbor knows this information. This raises the question: where is the line between the concept of privacy and the idea of consenting to shared information?</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term3/03-Intervention2/#what-if-transparency-was-more-valued-than-anything-else","title":"What if transparency was more valued than anything else?","text":"<p>22<sup>nd</sup> of April</p> <p>My second exploration was more of an open community question where I essentially asked what would happen if the world were 100% transparent. We already live in a world where transparency is part of our identity. We judge people based on the amount of information they share online. For example, you\u2019re more likely to be hired by a company if you have a well-developed LinkedIn profile and good connections than if you don\u2019t exist in any online space. The same applies to Instagram: when you have to get to know someone or someone starts following you, you\u2019re more likely to trust this person if they have many shared images and followers compared to someone with only 30 followers and one image.</p> <p>Thus, this transparency we\u2019ve integrated into our lives is already part of our daily reality. But my question was, what would happen if transparency were valued above all else? People don\u2019t realize that this mindset is already ingrained in us, but what do they think when you tell them that from now on, the more information you share, the more value you will have for society?</p> <p></p> <p>In this exploration, our classmates provided two types of feedback. Some believed that more transparency would lead to greater security, as it implies honesty from the government and less deception. Others expressed fear, highlighting the desire to choose when to be transparent. This fear stems from the potential exposure of personal information that one might prefer to keep private.</p> <p>In terms of security, transparency can reveal issues like abuse. There\u2019s a duality in transparency: while sharing information can help create a safer society by identifying problems and abuses, it also means losing control over who accesses our data.</p> <p>A fully transparent world means everyone\u2019s lives are exposed, raising concerns about consent. The balance between transparency and privacy is crucial. Extreme transparency can lead to public shaming and loss of privacy, but maintaining privacy ensures personal freedom.</p> <p>Feedback suggested that while transparency might seem beneficial, it can limit our choices and freedom. Knowing we\u2019re always being watched changes our behavior and restricts our freedom of expression.</p> <p>KEY TAKEAWAYS:The reflection from this small intervention was about finding the balance between privacy and transparency. How do we share data to create a safer world with people\u2019s consent and without abusing their privacy? In this case, what kind of information do we need for the greater good? If we\u2019re going to share data, it has to be for a common benefit. What kind of benefit is necessary for people to feel comfortable sharing their data?

Sa\u00fal is already a contact involved in my project, as his theme has always been about finding subversive techniques in the concept of surveillance. He focuses on finding algorithmic resistance through the creation of prosthetics.</p> <p>In his workshop, he explained his thesis, discussed the concept of surveillance, and encouraged us to explore what tools and types of prosthetics we would like to create to generate this kind of algorithmic resistance. The workshop included people who had no prior knowledge of the topic, and it was fascinating to see their reactions to the concept of surveillance. Some participants were unaware of the extent of this kind of surveillance. Sa\u00fal gave examples such as the surveillance in China using gait detection. He also explained the beginnings of surveillance and facial recognition and mentioned various tools used in this field, with a focus on biometric surveillance.</p> <p>Many participants had no idea how pervasive this surveillance was and created prosthetics to hide from this kind of monitoring and conceal their imperfections. We also met someone who makes face filters and shared their exploration of detecting and editing facial expressions.</p> <p></p> <p>KEY TAKEAWAYS: My takeaway from this workshop is that Sa\u00fal has a very specific perspective: fighting against surveillance by embedding within the algorithm itself. He aims not to avoid detection entirely, as being undetected can also draw excessive attention, but to hide within the system. I found this attempt to implement a tool for achieving personal privacy in a transparent world very interesting. However, it also raises a conflict for me because I don\u2019t believe all surveillance tools are inherently wrong. While it\u2019s true that surveillance is something we should be wary of, many of these tools are initially used for positive purposes, such as improving public safety or understanding clinical studies to enhance health outcomes. The problem lies not in data collection itself but in the lack of consent and the knowledge generated from these data not being shared with us.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term3/03-Intervention2/#reflection-on-my-research-so-far","title":"Reflection on my research so far","text":"<p>Summary of the key take aways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Privacy is subjective and often conflated with convenience, leading to acceptance of surveillance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Surveillance has evolved into a tool for public influence, raising concerns about its implications.</p> </li> <li> <p>There\u2019s a discrepancy in people\u2019s attitudes towards privacy depending on who has access to their information.</p> </li> <li> <p>The challenge lies not only in data collection but also in the generation of knowledge from that data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Surveillance tools are often developed for commercial purposes and influence.</p> </li> <li> <p>The focus should be on leveraging data and using surveillance tools for positive societal impact.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data can be utilized to prototype better, improve safety measures, and create accessible tools for societal benefit.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Primary focus:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create prototypes to educate people about the data collection methods used in their daily lives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raise awareness about the various data collection tools and techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate brainstorming sessions to explore the knowledge that can be generated to aid society using surveillance tools.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Very long reflection</p> <p>After conducting extensive research on various applications and the concept of privacy, as well as speaking with professionals and conducting explorations, I still have many doubts about the concept of surveillance. I believe that privacy is highly subjective because we already live in a world where we are constantly being watched, and it seems like we don\u2019t mind because we\u2019ve become accustomed to this surveillance. We often confuse privacy with convenience; if we\u2019re being watched, it supposedly means that our phones adapt better to us. However, the problem lies not in their better adaptation, but in the fact that sometimes computers, instead of trying to predict our next behavior, show us things to steer our behavior in a certain direction.</p> <p>The issue with surveillance isn\u2019t necessarily the concept of privacy, which society seems to be familiar with and not overly concerned about, but rather that this type of surveillance is becoming a tool for public influence. On one hand, it baffles me to think that people don\u2019t mind Google knowing all their passwords, credit card details, and preferences because Google supposedly only provides a service to improve user experience. However, we do mind if our neighbor knows this information. Therefore, as a society, we need to understand that there isn\u2019t much difference between our neighbor and Google. While Google may not currently focus on us individually, there may come a time when, armed with all the information it has, Google could use it as a political tool.</p> <p>Ultimately, what frustrates me isn\u2019t just the collection of data without our direct consent, although that is certainly something that requires reflection. My primary concern is the second step: the generation of knowledge that we don\u2019t have access to. So, how do we generate knowledge based on our data for public use, for public benefit? Most importantly, surveillance models are often not created with malicious intent but rather to increase sales, improve products, and enhance capitalism. Therefore, perhaps the key isn\u2019t necessarily to eliminate these surveillance tools, although that\u2019s something we should consider, but rather how we can use the data we share to create beneficial tools. How can we use this data to make positive contributions to society? Can these data help us prototype better? Can the tools we use to determine people\u2019s postures help us create accessible prototyping tools for others?</p> <p>Ultimately, what matters most to me is generating knowledge about the data we\u2019re collecting in our daily lives, understanding how people feel, and then asking the question: What can be interpreted from this data? What knowledge do we want to create from this data? And how can we use these surveillance technologies to improve the world? Not to monitor us, but since these technologies and incredibly vast databases already exist, what positive impact can we make on society with them?</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term3/04-Intervention3/","title":"Third Intervention: MDEFEST","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term3/04-Intervention3/#reflection-after-research-and-exploration","title":"Reflection after research and exploration","text":"<p>After organizing MdeFest, I realized that many people are indeed unfamiliar with the concepts of data privacy and surveillance. I believe my goal of creating interactive tools to visualize and communicate surveillance and data collection in a non-private manner worked well. By making it interactive and somewhat fun, I think people engaged more with the concept than with deep reflection. The tool surprised many because of its simplicity yet sparked conversations. What generated the most impact, in my opinion, amidst the Aggressive machine, Read The Room, and The Ad Profiler\u2014all detailed in my final paper written by Jorge Mu\u00f1oz\u2014was the ethical questions. Through interactive means, I prompted people to reflect on technology, surveillance, and privacy.</p> <p>From this, I noticed contradictions in people\u2019s views. While many believe privacy is a universal right and that having nothing to hide doesn\u2019t negate privacy, some admitted they don\u2019t consider themselves important enough to care why so much of their data is collected. Opinions varied on whether privacy is dead and on technology\u2019s role today. Some absolve technology of blame for current issues, while others blame it for eroding our privacy.</p> <p>Therefore, the MDEFest event I organized aimed to use interactive tools and informative posters to illustrate how much data individuals generate in a single day and how much information can be gathered about them. It aimed to make them reflect on how Meta and Facebook already collect vast amounts of data about them and whether what these platforms show us aligns with our desires or merely reflects what they think we\u2019ll like. It also aimed to provoke thoughts on free will: whether our actions are genuinely ours or simply taught to us.</p> <p>Reflecting back, while informative, the event lacked deeper reflections and actionable solutions. It was mainly about providing information. Personally, I hoped for more empowerment and action rather than mere reflection. Nonetheless, this topic remains crucial. As a designer, exploring it is challenging because my current role is mainly to educate others and ensure they understand. Moving forward, it\u2019s vital not only that people understand but also that I incorporate these concepts into my projects and acknowledge that technology, in my view, does impact society.

It was quite a whirlwind, but I gained a lot from it.</p> <p>One aspect I enjoyed was learning about the material we used, which was cork paste. I found it fascinating; it\u2019s a material still under investigation with a lot of potential. Exploring its resistance and seeing when it worked and when it didn\u2019t was fun. However, it also presented challenges. Since the paste is super liquid and viscous, mixing it with gelatin and water meant it never dried during printing, causing our prints to collapse.</p> <p>I also appreciated seeing how the robots operated, but one of the requirements was to use a plugin called Topos in Grasshopper, which is meant for generative design. The issue was that this plugin optimizes material distribution to handle required forces, but it prevents non-planar printing, which was the workshop\u2019s goal. So, while we used Topos, we ended up doing planar printing, similar to traditional 3D printing. This was a bit frustrating, as we didn\u2019t achieve the intended non-planar printing with the 6-axis robots.</p> <p>Overall, it was interesting and gave me a better understanding of how these robots work, but I still find them quite complex.

Still, we had a great time taking it apart, testing, and documenting every single piece of the microwave. I was lucky to have patient classmates around me who explained how everything worked.</p> <p>Although I wish I could talk more about how we disassembled the microwave, its different parts, and the technicalities of the project, this first week of the Machine Paradox Seminar made me think a lot about my past college education. I have studied electronics, done lots of theoretical circuit calculations, but I didn\u2019t know much about the actual parts of the microwave or how they were used. I now understand that my degree was too theoretical and not at all practical.

Experiential learning helps you understand and learn better and faster. I never found the workings of a microwave interesting before, but now I find it fascinating. Its manufacturing and repair processes are so complex yet amazing. We were surprised to discover how all the components were intricately connected. If one component broke, it affected all the others connected to it, requiring fixing and rewiring. We also learned how to easily fix and re-operate components just by connecting them to a power source.</p> <p>This week has inspired me to question how things work, and I\u2019m eager to take apart everything I can get my hands on.

We used  technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting prioritizing the refinement of intricate details within the machine rather than the complete structural overhaul. As our project progressed, we faced some challenges, such as issues with the quality of our prints because we only measured things once, leading to mistakes in the production process.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we made modifications to the machine\u2019s casings and added extra elements that made the machine more useless. This decision was influenced by the perception that the machine was too practical (as it could serve a legitimate need to cool down food), leading us to incorporate additional features to make it less functional. Consequently, we developed a system that allowed the machine to respond to specific actions, such as weight and movement. Once triggered, the machine would emit an annoying sound and cool down your food at the same time. To enhance users\u2019 understanding of the machine\u2019s functionality, we integrated printed designs and LED lights, making it more user-friendly.

In this case, I chose the feeling of independence because I relate it to my experience of living alone for a long time, away from my family. Although I sometimes consider myself an independent person, I also rely heavily on the people around me and my friends. For example, when I am sick, I need someone to come to my house to take care of me.</p> <p>I decided to represent my concept of independence through a model that symbolizes a boat. In this boat, I had control and carried my own flag and sail. Additionally, I incorporated an egg carton with four compartments that symbolized the four pillars of a person: the self, family, friends, and partner. My goal with the model was to add weight throughout the day to the compartments where I interacted. For example, if I spent time with my friends, I would place marbles in the friends\u2019 compartment. Similarly, if I dedicated time to myself, I would place marbles in the self-compartment, and so on with the family and partner.</p> <p>In my experiment, I tried to make the boat float, understanding that independence involves finding a stable balance between self-care and relationships with friends, a partner, and family. However, I noticed that by spending a lot of time with my friends, the space designated for friendship became so full that it started to encroach on other spaces, such as the family space. Also, by placing my friends and \u201cself\u201d on one side of the boat and the partner and family on the other, the boat constantly tipped to the left, given that I do not live with my family and do not have a partner. Over time, the boat sank, not only due to the excess weight and poor distribution of the pillars but also because the corks I had placed at the base to make it float came off. This observation led me to reflect on whether I truly am independent and if my concept of independence is misconstrued, which would imply that my boat sank because I did not build it properly. Maybe I don\u2019t need all the pilars to be independent. To make the boat float you just need balance but it will always tilt, a boat is never still. So independence should be the same, a continous journey of finding balance in your life and drive the boat of life with you as the captain.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-LivingIdeas/#living-with-ideas-my-exploration","title":"Living with Ideas: My exploration","text":"<p>I wanted to experience living without a phone, so I embarked on a 24-hour challenge, abstaining from music, Google Maps, WhatsApp, and the internet.

While fireflies naturally exhibit this trait, the goal is to transfer the genes associated with luciferase enzyme production and luciferin binding into Quercus ilex.</p> <p>The process involves genomic analysis of fireflies to identify key genes, including luciferase (Luc1) and luciferin-binding proteins. Genetic modification would then integrate the firefly luciferase gene into Quercus ilex plant cells. The challenge lies in enabling the plant to produce luciferin independently without relying on external chemical fuel for sustained bioluminescence. While genetically modifying the tree to synthesize luciferin is a potential solution, there are also alternative approaches that involve exploring how the plant might absorb luciferin, possibly through watering with a firefly compound.

Although Barcelona has a lot of green areas, they are not connected, creating \u201cdeserts\u201d for animals like bees as they move from one green space to another.</p> <p>We decided to focus on promoting biodiversity on a specific street in Poblenou, creating a green corridor where pollinating species could live within the city. We chose the Poble Nou area due to its proximity to IAAC, which would facilitate contact and exploration of spaces after classes. We selected a street that connected two known spaces: BAM and NestCityLab. BAM (Associai\u00f3 Bioarquitectura Meditarr\u00e0nea) is a community garden that we have already visited and that promotes bee life. NestCityLab is a green building with an internal garden, although its green space is closed to the outside. We wanted to communicate with them to open the space and promote the biodiversity corridor in Poble Nou.</p> <p>By choosing these spaces, we were interested in finding solutions to contribute to these communities actively interested in the subject. Initially, we thought about providing a product, such as a vertical farm, but we realized that this product designer perspective would lead us to offer a solution and then disappear from the community.</p> <p>So, we developed a plan over several months considering the limited duration of our presence at IAAC. We wanted to build a community interested in the project. We started with a discovery and information stage, conducting an advertising campaign to inform people on the street about our initiative.

It allowed me to perceive the city from a different perspective, viewing its issues and conflicts that we often overlook in our daily lives through different eyes. I also realized that creating solutions for a community involves engaging with and learning from that community. Contrary to the common approach where designers provide a solution, typically a product, to a community and then disengage, I\u2019ve come to understand that this isn\u2019t necessarily the only way to solve a problem. Designing for a community means becoming an integral part of it, actively contributing to constant change, and not abandoning the community once the design phase is completed.</p> <p>Moreover, this seminar has given me a new perspective on my city. While Barcelona has always seemed well-managed for humans, I now recognize, for the first time, that the city is exclusively designed for humans, lacking pathways for biodiversity and not fostering significant change. It also prompted reflection on the fact that solutions are often generated on a small scale, and this change can lead to conflicts in other spaces.

Therefore, perhaps from this conversation, instead of constantly trying to generate mental health technologies and products, I might want to step back and first explore how this technology can understand us better, and then, likely, explore creating products for mental health. Obviously, I need to figure out how this technology can understand me and what element I want the technology to grasp. Sa\u00fal has explored the concept of biometrics, but there are many more things about us that define us and that technology could read, such as the photos on our phones, our chats, our movements, our ethnicity, the music we like, among many other things, and these are data that are still being sold to different companies, so it\u2019s also interesting to explore how to use this data to understand a person without exploiting or selling it.</p>"},{"location":"term3/01-FutureTalks/#for-more-than-human-centered-worlds","title":"For More Than Human-Centered Worlds","text":""},{"location":"term3/01-FutureTalks/#contents_1","title":"Contents","text":"<p>In Helen Torres\u2019s class, we delved into the concept of the Anthropocene, where she challenged the notion that humanity itself is the problem, instead pinpointing \u201cman\u201d as individuals as the source of issues.

With AI quickly becoming a bigger part of our everyday lives, this project looks at whether these powerful tools, usually used to speed up production and benefit big companies, can instead be used to support local communities and give people more control over how things are designed and made. The central question guiding this work is: How can artificial intelligence be introduced and potentially integrated into community makerspaces to have easier access to design and fabrication without compromising ethical, educational, and collaborative values? Drawing from design theory and speculative frameworks, the project examines the role AI could and should play in a makerspace. Through conversations with professionals, educators, and technologists, and through hands-on experimentation with existing AI tools, the project develops a working hypothesis through three key phases:  (1) the formulation of a manifesto outlining AI\u2019s role in local design contexts; (2) the implementation of teaching strategies through workshops and public talks; and (3) the evaluation and development of accessible tooling for non-expert users. The research also raises important questions about what problems AI is truly solving. Is it strengthening how we work together in communities, or simply making us more reliant on quick, automated solutions? In the end, the research compiles practical feedback from field activities and suggests that while AI can be a useful tool, its real value depends on how it\u2019s introduced, alongside strong community values, and with a clear focus on keeping people, collaboration, and creativity at the heart of the making process.</p>"},{"location":"thesisY1/01-FrontPage/","title":"Explanation of the Project","text":""},{"location":"thesisY1/01-FrontPage/#_1","title":"Explanation of the Project","text":"<p>      Find out more about my exploration in my MDEF Journal    </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"thesisY1/01-FrontPage/#mdefest-unseen-exposures","title":"MDEFest: Unseen Exposures","text":"<p>For my final intervention this year, I hosted an event showcasing my interactive machines.
