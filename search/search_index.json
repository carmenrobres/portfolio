Although many of us shared an interest in repurposing waste and agreed that waste doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something worthless, our understanding of materials and waste was quite disorganized. We all acknowledged the need for a mindset shift towards recycling at home, and recognized the lack of awareness about waste management practices. We especially pondered the stark contrast in the availability of recycling bins in Barcelona compared to other European countries. Additionally, we emphasized the value and potential reuse of waste materials, sparking discussions about alternative material applications.</p> <p>While our collective understanding was generally aligned, each of us had specific focal points; some were solely interested in coffee, others in materials affecting the ocean, and some in plastics. Consequently, it was challenging to concentrate the Design Space\u2019s focus on a single material for our workshop, which was initially intended to demonstrate how to repurpose waste and generate new materials.</p> <p>Despite the complexities, engaging in the Design Space group was an enjoyable experience. We shared various articles and recommended different resources to each other, fostering a collaborative environment for expanding our knowledge. Moreover, this exchange allowed us to discover other projects and topics of interest among our classmates, which we could also integrate into our own Design Space.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#reflection-of-our-group-work","title":"Reflection of our group work","text":"<p> At first, we were very excited about setting up a workshop that focused on finding new ways to reuse our domestic waste. We were especially interested in exploring how to make new things from organic materials. We started the project with a lot of enthusiasm but didn\u2019t look into the best ways to actually repurpose these materials or what others had already figured out. This meant we didn\u2019t realize there was an extensive reservoir of untapped knowledge and resources available on the subject of repurposing waste materials, be it organic or synthetic.</p> <p>When we tried to put this knowledge into practice, we ran into some unexpected problems. ot only did we struggle to enjoy the process, but we also realized that our approach lacked a comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of waste management and sustainable practices. This made us take a step back and rethink about what we originally wanted to achieve. We started to wonder if what we were doing was actually helping.</p> <p>Consequently, we decided to try a different approach by creating an interactive survey as an intervention. We encouraged participants to reflect on their personal definitions of waste and their daily waste management habits, we sought to foster a deeper understanding of the underlying attitudes and perspectives driving individual actions. The survey showed us that people have different ideas about how to manage waste. Some think that repurposing things is a key part of recycling, while others aren\u2019t as sure and think we need to teach more about how to handle waste properly.</p> <p>This experience has solidified my belief that not everything falls solely on the individual\u2019s responsibility. There is a need for legislative changes and government and community involvement, as well as the creation of accessible pathways for people to adopt sustainable practices and for cities to become more environmentally friendly. Therefore, it\u2019s not just about conducting workshops on how to recycle materials, as this information already exists. The issue lies in the execution, which is hindered by the community and the current governmental structure.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#personal-design-space-updated","title":"Personal Design Space updated","text":"<p>Personally, I enjoyed this activity, but I\u2019ve realized as a designer that my goal of creating change has shifted. I now understand that materials already exist, solutions are in place, and technologies are available. What\u2019s needed is a specific focus and a societal shift. This involves changing our mindset, making sustainable choices easier, and ensuring recycling becomes a simple task. This intervention has made me aware that sustainability will always be a part of my life and remain a priority. However, as a designer, my interest has evolved. It\u2019s no longer about solely creating new materials or solving all the world\u2019s problems. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll always consider when crafting objects and generating new ideas, but it\u2019s no longer my primary focus or dedicated pursuit.</p> <p>Similarly, having reached this conclusion through this intervention, my question now is, what is my main interest as a designer? It\u2019s a challenging question to answer because I believe sustainability will always be at the heart of my work as a product designer. However, after starting this master\u2019s program, I\u2019ve come to realize that my interests extend beyond just the product itself to my personal inclinations. One area I\u2019ve yet to explore in my design space is my passion for food, which can also be tied to sustainability. I\u2019m also keenly interested in mental health, equality, and technology. I feel a strong inclination towards exploring mental well-being and would like to delve deeper into this area. Moreover, to make the most of my master\u2019s degree and to contemplate mental health in the future, I aim to utilize today\u2019s technologies to enhance the field of psychology.</p> <p>Furthermore, I want to focus on my identity and the identities of others, examining the implications of technology on a person\u2019s identity today. I am interested in understanding how this impacts our daily lives and how we have become reliant on technology. This decision has emerged from this intervention and a recent seminar that underscored my interest in exploring people\u2019s identities, their mental well-being, and their relationship with technology and dependency.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#my-new-design-space","title":"My new Design Space","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/","title":"Design Studio","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#roles-of-prototying","title":"Roles of Prototying","text":"<p> This was my first design studio class, and it was fascinating to discuss the different roles of prototyping and reflect on my own experiences with it. As an industrial design engineer, I have primarily engaged in role 1 prototyping. Initially, I perceived a prototype as a preliminary version of a functional object. To me, prototyping often involves navigating through frustrations, time constraints, and the pursuit of perfection.</p> <p>After the seminar, I became interested in roles 2 and 3. Role 2 focuses on gathering information and exploring new ideas, rather than just creating functional objects. This type of prototyping involves learning and collaborating with others. On the other hand, role 3, to me, feels like art \u2014 a way to encourage people to think about our society and learn from it. I realized that when I draw, paint, or work with ceramics, I\u2019m essentially creating prototypes that represent issues in our society.</p> <p>Though I find it challenging to implement role 4 in my current context, I am intrigued by its unique approach to prototyping. It appears to be an exciting and unconventional method that fosters discovery and collaboration through co-design and participatory design processes.</p> <p>Here are some examples of my prototyping experiences:</p> <p>Role 1: Redesign and prototyping of sustainable pulp paper corners for ROS furniture. The project aimed to protect furniture sides while promoting the use of eco-friendly materials in transportation. Despite the need for additional time and specialized tools for precise cutting, it offered efficient and user-friendly protection.</p> <p>Role 2: \u201cCreate Your Own Coffee Machine\u201d project. Our goal was to understand user preferences for a coffee machine. Through providing different button options and functionalities, we encouraged users to customize their ideal coffee machine.</p> <p>Role 3: Exploring art as a means of societal reflection.</p> <p>Role 4: Participation in the Spaghetti Tower Challenge.</p> <p>In the end, I\u2019ve realized just how important prototypes are in the whole process of creating something, even if they\u2019re not perfect. My recent realization has really made me curious about exploring prototyping in a new way, not just to make a final thing, but to learn and improve the whole process of creating something. I\u2019m eager to dive deeper into how prototyping can help us learn, grow, and make our projects even more awesome.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#prototype","title":"Prototype","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#interseguro-vehicular-app","title":"Interseguro Vehicular App","text":"Carmen \u00b7 Prototype explanation"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#rtd-tool-box","title":"Rtd Tool box","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/031-PersonalNarratives/","title":"Personal Narratives","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/031-PersonalNarratives/#deliverable","title":"Deliverable","text":"<p>Individual </p> <p>The figure that a choose for a personal narrative was a blanket.

This became our Collective Design Space:  </p> <p>In this intervention, our primary goal was to prompt our classmates to engage in thoughtful introspection about their digital identity\u2014considering both how they are currently perceived by others and how they aspire to be perceived. Given that our generation has grown up in a digital era, our online presence has become an integral part of our personal identity. We\u2019ve become accustomed to presenting ourselves within the constraints of various platforms, often utilizing a combination of text and images. However, we posed a critical question: Is our Instagram account, or any other digital representation, an authentic reflection of who we truly are? To explore this, we collaborated with classmates, fostering a collective space where we encouraged them to reflect on their self-perception based on their online identity and the impressions that strangers made of them in the digital realm.</p> <p>In order to make that happened we did the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>We asked our classmates for permission to show their Instagram profiles to our friends.</li> <li>We created a survey with very specific and limited response questions in order to have the same model with everyone. The questions were such as: Identify this persons sexuality, origin, recycling habits, travelling habits and self-care practices.  </li> <li> <p>We shared the social media profiles and asked our friends to fill out forms about each profile. Each profile was looked at only one time, so each classmate only got one digital identity.

For instance, we overlooked a question, specifically one about political opinions derived from Instagram accounts, which we found particularly interesting. I also believe we should have granted more freedom to our friends in their judgment. Instead of providing limited options for certain questions, such as the number of books they read, we should have allowed more subjective responses. This would have avoided generating similar profiles, making users appear less diverse. It would have been better to let people judging these profiles respond with more subjective questions or give them the freedom to say what they wanted. For example, asking them to judge their interests, how they perceive that person, whether they think the person is cheerful, sad, energetic, calm, their zodiac sign, etc. This approach would have allowed for more creativity rather than creating rigid profiles.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this project, and I believe both we and our classmates had a good time. It proved to be a valuable exercise, as everyone appreciated gaining insights into how others perceive them based on their social media profiles. Many were intrigued to view their Instagram profiles from different perspectives.

Many believed that bot-written texts are short, formal, and impersonal, with repetitive tones, indicating artificiality. However, when given a prompt mimicking a particular author\u2019s style, the AI produced a different tone, further confusing respondents. Most associated artificial intelligence with impersonality, formality, and repetition. Regarding images, people thought imperfections/glitches indicated artificiality, focusing on details like poorly drawn hands or overly detailed images. Creativity was also seen as a marker of human origin, though we were the ones promoting creativity.

In this second intervention, it\u2019s been classmates and members of the FABLAB community who\u2019ve been instrumental in assisting me with creating these technologies. Consequently, I must acknowledge that, in terms of community responsibility, I haven\u2019t effectively applied the concept of community interaction.

Had I been able to create the necessary technologies when required, I could have interacted with a broader range of communities.</p> <p>Overall, I believe my thesis lacks a direct connection to non-human elements and is clearly focused on what is human and essential to our identity. Mental health, in particular, is a universal concern, as is our interaction with technology in our daily lives and how it impacts our identity and self-perception. Therefore, as a designer and in terms of community responsibility, I feel I still need to create this community. My goal is to establish it with individuals who can openly discuss mental health and who may have some form of mental health issue. Thus far, I believe that in the future, I will continue learning and researching how to create these technologies and the best ways to reach these communities.

In the first intervention, I delved into understanding artificial intelligence and its potential application in decoding human identity and language. Subsequently, I utilized AI to understand the workings of various technologies and how to develop an element that aids in mental health improvement. Now, in this third intervention, my focus shifts to understanding the brain itself.</p> <p>Essentially, if my goal is to \u201chack\u201d the brain, how do scientists comprehend mental health and trauma, enabling me to understand it better? In this regard, I conducted an interview with a friend, In\u00e9s, who is an epigenetics scientist specializing in researching trauma and mental health.

Your parents faced challenges and had to adapt, so they want to set you up with the best tools to survive in this world. I wouldn\u2019t mess with that unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary, because nature is trying to make you fit in the best way possible.</p> <p>What\u2019s the bottom line?

In\u00e9s\u2019 viewpoint was intriguing; she emphasized that while the notion of trauma passing through generations via epigenetics may evoke concern, the focus should be on taking proactive measures.</p> <p>Acknowledging that trauma alters one\u2019s worldview, the emphasis lies on seeking therapy and making efforts to prevent future generations from enduring similar challenges. While trauma may have epigenetic implications, it doesn\u2019t guarantee the development of mental disorders in subsequent generations; it just indicates a predisposition. Therefore, aiding oneself can prevent such disorders from manifesting.</p> <p>This interview enlightened me on the communicative aspect of science and highlighted the complexity of \u201chacking\u201d the brain. Scientists understand the inputs and outputs but struggle to comprehend intricate processes like language acquisition or emotional regulation.In\u00e9s\u2019 insight also underscored the importance of creating technologies that facilitate self-awareness and emotional understanding without imposing on our natural tendencies.</p> <p>The objective isn\u2019t to eradicate sadness or trauma entirely but to develop technologies that assist in managing emotions without opposing their natural flow.

While researchers and scientists are beginning to comprehend our brains and generational trauma, there are numerous ethical implications regarding this type of research that still require reflection. Do we truly want to alter our epigenetics to reduce the trauma inherited across generations? Is combating generational trauma comparable to battling cancer, or does it risk compromising our human experience and resilience?  We must be careful in contemplating the intersection of technology and mental health, as ultimately, we are fighting with the essence of our own nature.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term2/05-DesignDialogues/","title":"Design Dialogues","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term2/05-DesignDialogues/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>The Design Dialogues served as a pivotal moment for me to hone in on the focus of my research.

Still, we had a great time taking it apart, testing, and documenting every single piece of the microwave. I was lucky to have patient classmates around me who explained how everything worked.</p> <p>Although I wish I could talk more about how we disassembled the microwave, its different parts, and the technicalities of the project, this first week of the Machine Paradox Seminar made me think a lot about my past college education. I have studied electronics, done lots of theoretical circuit calculations, but I didn\u2019t know much about the actual parts of the microwave or how they were used. I now understand that my degree was too theoretical and not at all practical. Despite memorizing various mathematical formulas and knowing how to do calculations with transistors, I had never actually built them in real life or seen one in person.</p> <p>During this one-week activity, I learned more than in my entire college experience. Experiential learning helps you understand and learn better and faster. I never found the workings of a microwave interesting before, but now I find it fascinating. Its manufacturing and repair processes are so complex yet amazing. We were surprised to discover how all the components were intricately connected. If one component broke, it affected all the others connected to it, requiring fixing and rewiring. We also learned how to easily fix and re-operate components just by connecting them to a power source.</p> <p>This week has inspired me to question how things work, and I\u2019m eager to take apart everything I can get my hands on.

We started our work with careful planning, and then we printed and put together the machine\u2019s parts. We used  technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting prioritizing the refinement of intricate details within the machine rather than the complete structural overhaul. As our project progressed, we faced some challenges, such as issues with the quality of our prints because we only measured things once, leading to mistakes in the production process.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we made modifications to the machine\u2019s casings and added extra elements that made the machine more useless. This decision was influenced by the perception that the machine was too practical (as it could serve a legitimate need to cool down food), leading us to incorporate additional features to make it less functional. Consequently, we developed a system that allowed the machine to respond to specific actions, such as weight and movement. Once triggered, the machine would emit an annoying sound and cool down your food at the same time. To enhance users\u2019 understanding of the machine\u2019s functionality, we integrated printed designs and LED lights, making it more user-friendly.

In this case, I chose the feeling of independence because I relate it to my experience of living alone for a long time, away from my family. Although I sometimes consider myself an independent person, I also rely heavily on the people around me and my friends. For example, when I am sick, I need someone to come to my house to take care of me.</p> <p>I decided to represent my concept of independence through a model that symbolizes a boat. In this boat, I had control and carried my own flag and sail. Additionally, I incorporated an egg carton with four compartments that symbolized the four pillars of a person: the self, family, friends, and partner. My goal with the model was to add weight throughout the day to the compartments where I interacted. For example, if I spent time with my friends, I would place marbles in the friends\u2019 compartment. Similarly, if I dedicated time to myself, I would place marbles in the self-compartment, and so on with the family and partner.</p> <p>In my experiment, I tried to make the boat float, understanding that independence involves finding a stable balance between self-care and relationships with friends, a partner, and family. However, I noticed that by spending a lot of time with my friends, the space designated for friendship became so full that it started to encroach on other spaces, such as the family space. Also, by placing my friends and \u201cself\u201d on one side of the boat and the partner and family on the other, the boat constantly tipped to the left, given that I do not live with my family and do not have a partner. Over time, the boat sank, not only due to the excess weight and poor distribution of the pillars but also because the corks I had placed at the base to make it float came off. This observation led me to reflect on whether I truly am independent and if my concept of independence is misconstrued, which would imply that my boat sank because I did not build it properly. Maybe I don\u2019t need all the pilars to be independent. To make the boat float you just need balance but it will always tilt, a boat is never still. So independence should be the same, a continous journey of finding balance in your life and drive the boat of life with you as the captain.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-LivingIdeas/#living-with-ideas-my-exploration","title":"Living with Ideas: My exploration","text":"<p>I wanted to experience living without a phone, so I embarked on a 24-hour challenge, abstaining from music, Google Maps, WhatsApp, and the internet.

Genetic modification would then integrate the firefly luciferase gene into Quercus ilex plant cells. The challenge lies in enabling the plant to produce luciferin independently without relying on external chemical fuel for sustained bioluminescence. While genetically modifying the tree to synthesize luciferin is a potential solution, there are also alternative approaches that involve exploring how the plant might absorb luciferin, possibly through watering with a firefly compound.

In this master\u2019s seminar, which essentially focuses on designing in a state of climate emergency, we\u2019ve delved into discussions about growth, human nature, time and various aspects of our own identity. Essentially, this seminar has allowed me to understand my position in this world, who I am, and what I can contribute as an entity and individual with the cultural, ecological and societal transformations shaping this decade. It has also enabled me to connect with the world and humanity at large, observing how we, as a collective, can connect with our planet.</p> <p>I believe this seminar has helped me personally to comprehend my relationship with my surroundings. At times, I find myself getting too absorbed in who I am, and ultimately, I recognize that I am just one entity and an event within the broader context of Earth and humanity. On the design front, I\u2019ve appreciated realizing that as designers, we are agents of change. However, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that society is undergoing a policrisis, and any changes we seek to make will likely be part of a global shift connected to the ongoing societal crisis.</p> <p>What resonates with me is the need to question things and break away from linear, capitalist thinking. It\u2019s about designing while connecting with our surroundings, the world, the Earth, and the sun\u2014attempting to stop the acceleration driven by capitalism and instead fostering connections with our environment. In essence, we are inevitably becoming transhuman, and humanity is evolving. We must draw inspiration from the past and the efforts of our ancestors to reach this point. From this seminar, I\u2019ve learned the importance of embracing the past with gratitude and drawing inspiration from it to shape the future.</p> <p>The fact that we are becoming users rather than individuals and the idea that it\u2019s easier to envision the end of the world than the end of capitalism are significant takeaways for me. Considering that my master\u2019s theme involves studying humanity and human identity as technology becomes integrated into our bodies, I\u2019m inspired to explore futures that go beyond mere technological integration and  understanding the socio-economic, socio-technical, and eco-sociological aspects of it. I want to examine the entirety of the future and society when proposing these exercises and learn from the past experiences of humanity to guide us in the future.</p> <p>From this seminar, I take away the importance of seeing the bigger picture. The problem I want to solve is part of a broader global issue, so I shouldn\u2019t feel overwhelmed. I\u2019ll approach it with patience, learning from the past to shape the future.

During the presentation, we learned about the Distributed Design Platform called Reflection Tree. Essentially, it\u2019s a tool that helps you review your own projects and practices. I used this tool to evaluate a project I worked on in the first trimester, which was about digital identity and artificial intelligence. Clearly, this project was more about my personal exploration into AI and identity. I didn\u2019t expect it to impact society but rather to affect my own understanding and approach to the topic. Using this tool made me realize that my previous projects related to AI and identity have been quite self-centered and subjective. I may need to reconsider how I approach my projects. While it\u2019s challenging to connect AI to sustainability, I could strive to make my projects more open and collaborative.
