Every day, I\u2019m gaining a lot of new knowledge, which reminds me why I decided to pursue this master\u2019s degree in the first place. Meeting fellow students and educators this week has been truly inspiring, and I believe we\u2019re all set for an enriching journey where we\u2019ll learn and grow together as a class and comunity. Yet, amidst this external adventure, I\u2019m also dealing with a personal challenge. I\u2019ve come to realize that if I want to make a positive impact on the world, I first need to confront my own biases, habits, and thoughts that have been shaped by society and my upbringing. My biggest struggle right now is with myself. I aspire to open my mind to new information and fresh ways of thinking and creating, but I must overcome self-doubt as a starting point. This week, we\u2019ve delved into the concept of transhackfeminism, decolonizing technologies and also talked about the fact designers should draw from personal experiences to design for the future. However, my mind is still filled with questions like: Am I capable enough for this master\u2019s program? Can I actively contribute to class discussions and add value to our group? Will I be able to grasp everything they\u2019re teaching us? Nevertheless, every day in class, I learn new things from my classmates, and it\u2019s evident that all of us share some level of insecurity regarding the master\u2019s program. While we\u2019re enthusiastic about the journey, we\u2019re still figuring out how to contribute our knowledge effectively. To sum it up, this week has taught me that my journey won\u2019t be a perfect, straightforward path; there will be plenty of mistakes along the way as I learn and grow. I\u2019m actively working on becoming more open-minded, creative, and adept at expressing my ideas clearly while exploring various subjects. My primary goal remains making a positive impact, and although I have a general direction in mind, I\u2019m open to discovering new interests and possibilities along the way.","title":"Landing"},{"location":"term1/01-Landing/#landing","text":"October 8 th As I step into this new phase of my education and career journey, I can\u2019t help but feel excited about the fresh changes and opportunities ahead.
