As an industrial design engineer, I have primarily engaged in role 1 prototyping. Initially, I perceived a prototype as a preliminary version of a functional object. To me, prototyping often involves navigating through frustrations, time constraints, and the pursuit of perfection.</p> <p>After the seminar, I became interested in roles 2 and 3. Role 2 focuses on gathering information and exploring new ideas, rather than just creating functional objects. This type of prototyping involves learning and collaborating with others. On the other hand, role 3, to me, feels like art \u2014 a way to encourage people to think about our society and learn from it. I realized that when I draw, paint, or work with ceramics, I\u2019m essentially creating prototypes that represent issues in our society.</p> <p>Though I find it challenging to implement role 4 in my current context, I am intrigued by its unique approach to prototyping. It appears to be an exciting and unconventional method that fosters discovery and collaboration through co-design and participatory design processes.</p> <p>Here are some examples of my prototyping experiences:</p> <p>Role 1: Redesign and prototyping of sustainable pulp paper corners for ROS furniture. The project aimed to protect furniture sides while promoting the use of eco-friendly materials in transportation. Despite the need for additional time and specialized tools for precise cutting, it offered efficient and user-friendly protection.</p> <p>Role 2: \u201cCreate Your Own Coffee Machine\u201d project. Our goal was to understand user preferences for a coffee machine. Through providing different button options and functionalities, we encouraged users to customize their ideal coffee machine.</p> <p>Role 3: Exploring art as a means of societal reflection.</p> <p>Role 4: Participation in the Spaghetti Tower Challenge.</p> <p>In the end, I\u2019ve realized just how important prototypes are in the whole process of creating something, even if they\u2019re not perfect. My recent realization has really made me curious about exploring prototyping in a new way, not just to make a final thing, but to learn and improve the whole process of creating something. I\u2019m eager to dive deeper into how prototyping can help us learn, grow, and make our projects even more awesome.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/03-Prototyping/#prototype","title":"Prototype","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/03-Prototyping/#interseguro-vehicular-app","title":"Interseguro Vehicular App","text":"Carmen \u00b7 Prototype explanation"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/03-Prototyping/#rtd-tool-box","title":"Rtd Tool box","text":""},{"location":"about/me/","title":"About me","text":""},{"location":"about/me/#a-little-too-personal","title":"A little too personal?","text":"<p> I don\u2019t really know who I am, so I\u2019m going to explain to you what I like.

We initially thought it would be fun to dismantle it, but as we started, we realized how difficult and risky it was due to the AC circuits and the capacitor. Still, we had a great time taking it apart, testing, and documenting every single piece of the microwave. I was lucky to have patient classmates around me who explained how everything worked.</p> <p>Although I wish I could talk more about how we disassembled the microwave, its different parts, and the technicalities of the project, this first week of the Machine Paradox Seminar made me think a lot about my past college education. I have studied electronics, done lots of theoretical circuit calculations, but I didn\u2019t know much about the actual parts of the microwave or how they were used. I now understand that my degree was too theoretical and not at all practical. Despite memorizing various mathematical formulas and knowing how to do calculations with transistors, I had never actually built them in real life or seen one in person.</p> <p>During this one-week activity, I learned more than in my entire college experience. Experiential learning helps you understand and learn better and faster. I never found the workings of a microwave interesting before, but now I find it fascinating. Its manufacturing and repair processes are so complex yet amazing. We were surprised to discover how all the components were intricately connected. If one component broke, it affected all the others connected to it, requiring fixing and rewiring. We also learned how to easily fix and re-operate components just by connecting them to a power source.</p> <p>This week has inspired me to question how things work, and I\u2019m eager to take apart everything I can get my hands on.

We started our work with careful planning, and then we printed and put together the machine\u2019s parts. We used  technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting prioritizing the refinement of intricate details within the machine rather than the complete structural overhaul. As our project progressed, we faced some challenges, such as issues with the quality of our prints because we only measured things once, leading to mistakes in the production process.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we made modifications to the machine\u2019s casings and added extra elements that made the machine more useless. This decision was influenced by the perception that the machine was too practical (as it could serve a legitimate need to cool down food), leading us to incorporate additional features to make it less functional. Consequently, we developed a system that allowed the machine to respond to specific actions, such as weight and movement. Once triggered, the machine would emit an annoying sound and cool down your food at the same time. To enhance users\u2019 understanding of the machine\u2019s functionality, we integrated printed designs and LED lights, making it more user-friendly.

In this case, I chose the feeling of independence because I relate it to my experience of living alone for a long time, away from my family. Although I sometimes consider myself an independent person, I also rely heavily on the people around me and my friends. For example, when I am sick, I need someone to come to my house to take care of me.</p> <p>I decided to represent my concept of independence through a model that symbolizes a boat. In this boat, I had control and carried my own flag and sail. Additionally, I incorporated an egg carton with four compartments that symbolized the four pillars of a person: the self, family, friends, and partner. My goal with the model was to add weight throughout the day to the compartments where I interacted. For example, if I spent time with my friends, I would place marbles in the friends\u2019 compartment. Similarly, if I dedicated time to myself, I would place marbles in the self-compartment, and so on with the family and partner.</p> <p>In my experiment, I tried to make the boat float, understanding that independence involves finding a stable balance between self-care and relationships with friends, a partner, and family. However, I noticed that by spending a lot of time with my friends, the space designated for friendship became so full that it started to encroach on other spaces, such as the family space. Also, by placing my friends and \u201cself\u201d on one side of the boat and the partner and family on the other, the boat constantly tipped to the left, given that I do not live with my family and do not have a partner. Over time, the boat sank, not only due to the excess weight and poor distribution of the pillars but also because the corks I had placed at the base to make it float came off. This observation led me to reflect on whether I truly am independent and if my concept of independence is misconstrued, which would imply that my boat sank because I did not build it properly. Maybe I don\u2019t need all the pilars to be independent. To make the boat float you just need balance but it will always tilt, a boat is never still. So independence should be the same, an continous journey of finding balance in your life and drive the boat of life with you as the captain.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-LivingIdeas/#living-with-ideas-my-exploration","title":"Living with Ideas: My exploration","text":"<p>I wanted to experience living without a phone, so I embarked on a 24-hour challenge, abstaining from music, Google Maps, WhatsApp, and the internet.
