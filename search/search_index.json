For me, the best experiences are those that engage all five senses; that\u2019s why one of my favorite things in this world is food. There are no great trips without experiencing the local cuisine, no gatherings with friends without good tapas, and undoubtedly, no movies without popcorn. I love discovering new places to explore different flavors and cuisines. Besides food, I\u2019m a wine and coffee enthusiast. I\u2019ll never say no to either of those two drinks, but I will say no to beer.</p> <p>I\u2019m a frustrated artist in search of new hobbies; I paint, draw, work with ceramics, and now I\u2019ve discovered my new obsession: knitting. Still, I keep making scarves because I haven\u2019t learned to do anything else yet :).</p> <p>I used to be a natural athlete; I played tennis and practiced taekwondo. However, due to a knee injury, I\u2019ve become a person glued to the couch and incapable of going to the gym more than twice a week (and that\u2019s me being generous).</p> <p>I was raised in a very strict school where I learned that in life, you can only aspire to be the best at everything, and if you\u2019re not the smartest in the group, you\u2019re wasting your time. Now, as an adult, this has left me with an inability to accept defeat and a long journey to deconstruct the bad habits of perfectionism.</p> <p>As a designer, I dream of becoming someone others look up to and being a catalyst for change in society. Sustainability motivates me, and I firmly believe that recycling in Spain is a scam, and we should find other ways to manage waste and materials.</p> <p>The most important thing in my life is my friends; they are what I value most in this world, and I would do anything for them (I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I would help them bury a body if they ever killed someone). I don\u2019t enjoy partying, but I\u2019m willing to have conversations until 5 in the morning on all kinds of relevant topics, like the importance of religion or whether a good spanish tortilla should be made with or without onions (always with).</p> <p>Currently, I\u2019m in a phase of self-discovery and healing from past wounds that have affected my mental health. I\u2019m very excited to start the MDEF master\u2019s program at IAAC because I know it will help me deconstruct my habits and beliefs, learn more about the world and myself, and enable me to contribute to our society</p>"},{"location":"about/me/#if-my-life-was-a-movie-this-would-be-my-soundtrack","title":"If my life was a movie this would be my soundtrack","text":""},{"location":"project/project/","title":"Initial ideas","text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Every day, I\u2019m gaining a lot of new knowledge, which reminds me why I decided to pursue this master\u2019s degree in the first place. Meeting fellow students and educators this week has been truly inspiring, and I believe we\u2019re all set for an enriching journey where we\u2019ll learn and grow together as a class and comunity.</p> <p>Yet, amidst this external adventure, I\u2019m also dealing with a personal challenge. I\u2019ve come to realize that if I want to make a positive impact on the world, I first need to confront my own biases, habits, and thoughts that have been shaped by society and my upbringing. My biggest struggle right now is with myself. I aspire to open my mind to new information and fresh ways of thinking and creating, but I must overcome self-doubt as a starting point. This week, we\u2019ve delved into the concept of transhackfeminism, decolonizing technologies and also talked about the fact designers should draw from personal experiences to design for the future. However, my mind is still filled with questions like: Am I capable enough for this master\u2019s program? Can I actively contribute to class discussions and add value to our group? Will I be able to grasp everything they\u2019re teaching us?  Nevertheless, every day in class, I learn new things from my classmates, and it\u2019s evident that all of us share some level of insecurity regarding the master\u2019s program. While we\u2019re enthusiastic about the journey, we\u2019re still figuring out how to contribute our knowledge effectively.</p> <p>To sum it up, this week has taught me that my journey won\u2019t be a perfect, straightforward path; there will be plenty of mistakes along the way as I learn and grow. I\u2019m actively working on becoming more open-minded, creative, and adept at expressing my ideas clearly while exploring various subjects. My primary goal remains making a positive impact, and although I have a general direction in mind, I\u2019m open to discovering new interests and possibilities along the way.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/01-Landing/#day-to-day","title":"Day to day","text":""},{"location":"term1/01-Landing/#the-objects-that-defines-us","title":"THE OBJECTS THAT DEFINES US","text":"<p>On the first day of class we talked about the objects that are connected to your identity, history, background, wishes, desires, or interests. This exercise helped me get to know my classmates better and learn about their backgrounds and experiences. It also made me realize how objects can have various meanings for us. As a product designer, I aspire to create something in the future that is so essential and personal that it becomes a part of who you are and reflects your identity and desires. It is funny how a shoe or a simple watch can be part of your background and history and can mean something more than just the purpose it was made for. </p>"},{"location":"term1/01-Landing/#discovering-a-new-barcelona-the-secrets-of-poblenou","title":"DISCOVERING A NEW BARCELONA: The secrets of Poblenou","text":"<p>Being from Barcelona, it was really exciting to explore new places I\u2019ve never been before.

Throughout my academic journey, I had considered studying there for both my bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. However, I always felt that my technical background might not align with the design focus of the school.</p> <p>Elisava boasts impressive facilities and a wealth of laboratories that encourage curiosity and learning. In my opinion, I\u2019ve made the right choice by pursuing this master\u2019s program at Iaac. It\u2019s evident that Elisava has a large student body with numerous classes and seminars, which means you may feel like just another student in the daily routine. In contrast, at IAAC, you become part of a close-knit community, offering you the freedom to design without constraints.</p> <p>Choosing this master\u2019s program offers the best of both worlds. You can enjoy the privilege of utilizing Elisava\u2019s labs while also benefiting from the freedom that IAAC provides, allowing you to use the Fab Lab for your individual projects. </p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals","text":""},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>At the beginning of the week I didn\u2019t know what to expect from this course nor did I know what \u201cweak signals\u201d were. After navigating through different topics, playing with our Atlas of Weak Signals card game and debating with our classmates, I started to understand the concept and purpose of this seminar. The main focus of this class was for us to understand that designing for emergent futures can be difficult since we do not know what the future might be, and that in order for us to design we need to sit with ourselves and determine every fragile indicator within our lives that has the potential in changing the future.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#first-deliverable","title":"First deliverable","text":"<p>During the course of the week we were told to explore the cards and pick the ones that relate more to us. We were little by little creating our own Design Space in which we mirrored our lives, passions, thoughts and old projects. With that in mind, we were designing a clear image of what proactive strategies we could do to support our interests and contribute positively to society to create and adapt to change. In my case, coming from a background in product design engineering and growing up as a 23-year-old woman in a society influenced by technology, media, and a patriarchal family, I\u2019ve developed various interests that drive me to seek change in our current societal norms.

These mainly reflect the challenges I encounter in my personal life on a daily basis. Nevertheless, I am increasingly determined to discover solutions and new methodologies that align with the future I envisage in my Design Space. For me, it\u2019s about delving deeper into comprehension and awareness. Understanding more enables us to shape our future, and acknowledging problems is the first step in overcoming them. I aspire to begin addressing these issues at a local level and subsequently expand my efforts to other communities. My aim is to create something that promotes sustainable diets, products with shorter life cycles, and societal changes that foster a community with direct access to knowledge and equal opportunities.</p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#my-first-atlas-of-weak-signals","title":"My First Atlas of Weak Signals","text":""},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#my-card-additions","title":"My Card Additions","text":""},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#multiscalar-design-space","title":"Multiscalar Design Space","text":""}]}
