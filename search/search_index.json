Although many of us shared an interest in repurposing waste and agreed that waste doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something worthless, our understanding of materials and waste was quite disorganized. We all acknowledged the need for a mindset shift towards recycling at home, and recognized the lack of awareness about waste management practices. We especially pondered the stark contrast in the availability of recycling bins in Barcelona compared to other European countries. Additionally, we emphasized the value and potential reuse of waste materials, sparking discussions about alternative material applications.</p> <p>While our collective understanding was generally aligned, each of us had specific focal points; some were solely interested in coffee, others in materials affecting the ocean, and some in plastics. Consequently, it was challenging to concentrate the Design Space\u2019s focus on a single material for our workshop, which was initially intended to demonstrate how to repurpose waste and generate new materials.</p> <p>Despite the complexities, engaging in the Design Space group was an enjoyable experience. We shared various articles and recommended different resources to each other, fostering a collaborative environment for expanding our knowledge. Moreover, this exchange allowed us to discover other projects and topics of interest among our classmates, which we could also integrate into our own Design Space.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#reflection-of-our-group-work","title":"Reflection of our group work","text":"<p> At first, we were very excited about setting up a workshop that focused on finding new ways to reuse our domestic waste. We were especially interested in exploring how to make new things from organic materials. We started the project with a lot of enthusiasm but didn\u2019t look into the best ways to actually repurpose these materials or what others had already figured out. This meant we didn\u2019t realize there was an extensive reservoir of untapped knowledge and resources available on the subject of repurposing waste materials, be it organic or synthetic.</p> <p>When we tried to put this knowledge into practice, we ran into some unexpected problems. ot only did we struggle to enjoy the process, but we also realized that our approach lacked a comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of waste management and sustainable practices. This made us take a step back and rethink about what we originally wanted to achieve. We started to wonder if what we were doing was actually helping.</p> <p>Consequently, we decided to try a different approach by creating an interactive survey as an intervention. We encouraged participants to reflect on their personal definitions of waste and their daily waste management habits, we sought to foster a deeper understanding of the underlying attitudes and perspectives driving individual actions. The survey showed us that people have different ideas about how to manage waste. Some think that repurposing things is a key part of recycling, while others aren\u2019t as sure and think we need to teach more about how to handle waste properly.</p> <p>This experience has solidified my belief that not everything falls solely on the individual\u2019s responsibility. There is a need for legislative changes and government and community involvement, as well as the creation of accessible pathways for people to adopt sustainable practices and for cities to become more environmentally friendly. Therefore, it\u2019s not just about conducting workshops on how to recycle materials, as this information already exists. The issue lies in the execution, which is hindered by the community and the current governmental structure.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#personal-design-space-updated","title":"Personal Design Space updated","text":"<p>Personally, I enjoyed this activity, but I\u2019ve realized as a designer that my goal of creating change has shifted. I now understand that materials already exist, solutions are in place, and technologies are available. What\u2019s needed is a specific focus and a societal shift. This involves changing our mindset, making sustainable choices easier, and ensuring recycling becomes a simple task. This intervention has made me aware that sustainability will always be a part of my life and remain a priority. However, as a designer, my interest has evolved. It\u2019s no longer about solely creating new materials or solving all the world\u2019s problems. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll always consider when crafting objects and generating new ideas, but it\u2019s no longer my primary focus or dedicated pursuit.</p> <p>Similarly, having reached this conclusion through this intervention, my question now is, what is my main interest as a designer? It\u2019s a challenging question to answer because I believe sustainability will always be at the heart of my work as a product designer. However, after starting this master\u2019s program, I\u2019ve come to realize that my interests extend beyond just the product itself to my personal inclinations. One area I\u2019ve yet to explore in my design space is my passion for food, which can also be tied to sustainability. I\u2019m also keenly interested in mental health, equality, and technology. I feel a strong inclination towards exploring mental well-being and would like to delve deeper into this area. Moreover, to make the most of my master\u2019s degree and to contemplate mental health in the future, I aim to utilize today\u2019s technologies to enhance the field of psychology.</p> <p>Furthermore, I want to focus on my identity and the identities of others, examining the implications of technology on a person\u2019s identity today. I am interested in understanding how this impacts our daily lives and how we have become reliant on technology. This decision has emerged from this intervention and a recent seminar that underscored my interest in exploring people\u2019s identities, their mental well-being, and their relationship with technology and dependency.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/02-Intervention/#my-new-design-space","title":"My new Design Space","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/","title":"Design Studio","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#roles-of-prototying","title":"Roles of Prototying","text":"<p> This was my first design studio class, and it was fascinating to discuss the different roles of prototyping and reflect on my own experiences with it. As an industrial design engineer, I have primarily engaged in role 1 prototyping. Initially, I perceived a prototype as a preliminary version of a functional object. To me, prototyping often involves navigating through frustrations, time constraints, and the pursuit of perfection.</p> <p>After the seminar, I became interested in roles 2 and 3. Role 2 focuses on gathering information and exploring new ideas, rather than just creating functional objects. This type of prototyping involves learning and collaborating with others. On the other hand, role 3, to me, feels like art \u2014 a way to encourage people to think about our society and learn from it. I realized that when I draw, paint, or work with ceramics, I\u2019m essentially creating prototypes that represent issues in our society.</p> <p>Though I find it challenging to implement role 4 in my current context, I am intrigued by its unique approach to prototyping. It appears to be an exciting and unconventional method that fosters discovery and collaboration through co-design and participatory design processes.</p> <p>Here are some examples of my prototyping experiences:</p> <p>Role 1: Redesign and prototyping of sustainable pulp paper corners for ROS furniture. The project aimed to protect furniture sides while promoting the use of eco-friendly materials in transportation. Despite the need for additional time and specialized tools for precise cutting, it offered efficient and user-friendly protection.</p> <p>Role 2: \u201cCreate Your Own Coffee Machine\u201d project. Our goal was to understand user preferences for a coffee machine. Through providing different button options and functionalities, we encouraged users to customize their ideal coffee machine.</p> <p>Role 3: Exploring art as a means of societal reflection.</p> <p>Role 4: Participation in the Spaghetti Tower Challenge.</p> <p>In the end, I\u2019ve realized just how important prototypes are in the whole process of creating something, even if they\u2019re not perfect. My recent realization has really made me curious about exploring prototyping in a new way, not just to make a final thing, but to learn and improve the whole process of creating something. I\u2019m eager to dive deeper into how prototyping can help us learn, grow, and make our projects even more awesome.</p>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#prototype","title":"Prototype","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#interseguro-vehicular-app","title":"Interseguro Vehicular App","text":"Carmen \u00b7 Prototype explanation"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/03-Prototyping/#rtd-tool-box","title":"Rtd Tool box","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/031-PersonalNarratives/","title":"Personal Narratives","text":""},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/031-PersonalNarratives/#deliverable","title":"Deliverable","text":"<p>Individual </p> <p>The figure that a choose for a personal narrative was a blanket.

This became our Collective Design Space:  </p> <p>In this intervention, our primary goal was to prompt our classmates to engage in thoughtful introspection about their digital identity\u2014considering both how they are currently perceived by others and how they aspire to be perceived. Given that our generation has grown up in a digital era, our online presence has become an integral part of our personal identity. We\u2019ve become accustomed to presenting ourselves within the constraints of various platforms, often utilizing a combination of text and images. However, we posed a critical question: Is our Instagram account, or any other digital representation, an authentic reflection of who we truly are? To explore this, we collaborated with classmates, fostering a collective space where we encouraged them to reflect on their self-perception based on their online identity and the impressions that strangers made of them in the digital realm.</p> <p>In order to make that happened we did the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>We asked our classmates for permission to show their Instagram profiles to our friends.</li> <li>We created a survey with very specific and limited response questions in order to have the same model with everyone. The questions were such as: Identify this persons sexuality, origin, recycling habits, travelling habits and self-care practices.  </li> <li> <p>We shared the social media profiles and asked our friends to fill out forms about each profile. Each profile was looked at only one time, so each classmate only got one digital identity. Different friends of ours assisted in examining our classmates, so it\u2019s crucial to understand that every digital identity we created depends on their personal opinions. Each person had different criteria for determining what was important in identifying that person.  </p> </li> <li> <p>We gathered information on the profiles and organized them into anonymous cards to prepare for the game.</p> </li> <li> <p>We invited our classmates to engage in a participatory exercise where they were prompted to associate themselves with one of the profiles exhibited on the wall.

This interactive initiative not only facilitated meaningful conversations regarding individual self-perceptions but also yielded valuable insights into how participants perceive themselves within the framework of our collaborative project.  </p> </li> <li> <p>We then revealed the final solution  that matched each profile to its respective individual and documented their responses. </p> </li> <li> <p>We conducted interviews to ascertain whether individuals identified with the descriptions provided by our friends.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"03-DesignStudioF/term1/04-Intervention2/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>In retrospect, there are a few things I would have done differently in this project. For instance, we overlooked a question, specifically one about political opinions derived from Instagram accounts, which we found particularly interesting. I also believe we should have granted more freedom to our friends in their judgment. Instead of providing limited options for certain questions, such as the number of books they read, we should have allowed more subjective responses. This would have avoided generating similar profiles, making users appear less diverse. It would have been better to let people judging these profiles respond with more subjective questions or give them the freedom to say what they wanted. For example, asking them to judge their interests, how they perceive that person, whether they think the person is cheerful, sad, energetic, calm, their zodiac sign, etc. This approach would have allowed for more creativity rather than creating rigid profiles.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this project, and I believe both we and our classmates had a good time. It proved to be a valuable exercise, as everyone appreciated gaining insights into how others perceive them based on their social media profiles. Many were intrigued to view their Instagram profiles from different perspectives. Some even expressed uncertainty about whether they truly reflected certain characteristics, prompting them to revisit their own profiles for self-reflection.

Social media has become a passive exercise ingrained in the need to express ourselves, with few truly reflecting on their Instagram presentations.</p> <p>The exercise intrigued individuals with Instagram accounts, sparking curiosity about how others perceive them. However, the desire for validation through social media profiles should be questioned. It would have been beneficial to reflect more on individuals\u2019 feelings, intentions, and whether their social media profiles truly represent them.

This led me to delve into the concept of communication. Once I identified what I wanted to communicate, I focused on the type of conversation I, as a designer, wanted to initiate. I became particularly interested in the concepts of identity and mental health. Consequently, I conducted two interventions: one on my phone dependency and self-identity, and another on how we present ourselves on social media. I engaged others in reflecting on social identity and our own identity in the context of technology. Subsequently, I delved into artificial intelligence during Design Dialogues, collecting data related to its impact on mental health and the creation of personal data for AI.

Therefore, our final intervention focused on analyzing and creating a test for people to respond to. Essentially, we presented them with images, voices, or texts and asked them to determine whether they were generated by artificial intelligence or by humans. Our goal wasn\u2019t to assess whether participants answered the test questions correctly or incorrectly, but rather to understand the criteria they used to differentiate between human and artificial creations.

People couldn\u2019t accurately discern between a human voice and one produced by a bot, nor could they distinguish between drawings, images, and texts. The test was deliberately designed to confuse participants, making them to think deeply and reflect. Many believed that bot-written texts are short, formal, and impersonal, with repetitive tones, indicating artificiality. However, when given a prompt mimicking a particular author\u2019s style, the AI produced a different tone, further confusing respondents. Most associated artificial intelligence with impersonality, formality, and repetition. Regarding images, people thought imperfections/glitches indicated artificiality, focusing on details like poorly drawn hands or overly detailed images. Creativity was also seen as a marker of human origin, though we were the ones promoting creativity. In terms of voice, most expected a monotone and robotic sound, but when pauses were human-like, confusion ensued. Overall, the inability to differentiate highlighted the challenge of identifying truly human characteristics in AI-generated content.</p> <p>In the end, what is commonly associated with Artificial Intelligence is often uncreative, overly perfect yet lacking in detail, very formal, impersonal, and less natural.

Ultimately, the reflection is that if we truly understand how to use this tool, we can also mimic this naturalness.

We initially thought it would be fun to dismantle it, but as we started, we realized how difficult and risky it was due to the AC circuits and the capacitor. Still, we had a great time taking it apart, testing, and documenting every single piece of the microwave. I was lucky to have patient classmates around me who explained how everything worked.</p> <p>Although I wish I could talk more about how we disassembled the microwave, its different parts, and the technicalities of the project, this first week of the Machine Paradox Seminar made me think a lot about my past college education. I have studied electronics, done lots of theoretical circuit calculations, but I didn\u2019t know much about the actual parts of the microwave or how they were used. I now understand that my degree was too theoretical and not at all practical. Despite memorizing various mathematical formulas and knowing how to do calculations with transistors, I had never actually built them in real life or seen one in person.</p> <p>During this one-week activity, I learned more than in my entire college experience. Experiential learning helps you understand and learn better and faster. I never found the workings of a microwave interesting before, but now I find it fascinating. Its manufacturing and repair processes are so complex yet amazing. We were surprised to discover how all the components were intricately connected. If one component broke, it affected all the others connected to it, requiring fixing and rewiring. We also learned how to easily fix and re-operate components just by connecting them to a power source.</p> <p>This week has inspired me to question how things work, and I\u2019m eager to take apart everything I can get my hands on.

We started our work with careful planning, and then we printed and put together the machine\u2019s parts. We used  technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting prioritizing the refinement of intricate details within the machine rather than the complete structural overhaul. As our project progressed, we faced some challenges, such as issues with the quality of our prints because we only measured things once, leading to mistakes in the production process.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we made modifications to the machine\u2019s casings and added extra elements that made the machine more useless. This decision was influenced by the perception that the machine was too practical (as it could serve a legitimate need to cool down food), leading us to incorporate additional features to make it less functional. Consequently, we developed a system that allowed the machine to respond to specific actions, such as weight and movement. Once triggered, the machine would emit an annoying sound and cool down your food at the same time. To enhance users\u2019 understanding of the machine\u2019s functionality, we integrated printed designs and LED lights, making it more user-friendly.

In this case, I chose the feeling of independence because I relate it to my experience of living alone for a long time, away from my family. Although I sometimes consider myself an independent person, I also rely heavily on the people around me and my friends. For example, when I am sick, I need someone to come to my house to take care of me.</p> <p>I decided to represent my concept of independence through a model that symbolizes a boat. In this boat, I had control and carried my own flag and sail. Additionally, I incorporated an egg carton with four compartments that symbolized the four pillars of a person: the self, family, friends, and partner. My goal with the model was to add weight throughout the day to the compartments where I interacted. For example, if I spent time with my friends, I would place marbles in the friends\u2019 compartment. Similarly, if I dedicated time to myself, I would place marbles in the self-compartment, and so on with the family and partner.</p> <p>In my experiment, I tried to make the boat float, understanding that independence involves finding a stable balance between self-care and relationships with friends, a partner, and family. However, I noticed that by spending a lot of time with my friends, the space designated for friendship became so full that it started to encroach on other spaces, such as the family space. Also, by placing my friends and \u201cself\u201d on one side of the boat and the partner and family on the other, the boat constantly tipped to the left, given that I do not live with my family and do not have a partner. Over time, the boat sank, not only due to the excess weight and poor distribution of the pillars but also because the corks I had placed at the base to make it float came off. This observation led me to reflect on whether I truly am independent and if my concept of independence is misconstrued, which would imply that my boat sank because I did not build it properly. Maybe I don\u2019t need all the pilars to be independent. To make the boat float you just need balance but it will always tilt, a boat is never still. So independence should be the same, a continous journey of finding balance in your life and drive the boat of life with you as the captain.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/06-LivingIdeas/#living-with-ideas-my-exploration","title":"Living with Ideas: My exploration","text":"<p>I wanted to experience living without a phone, so I embarked on a 24-hour challenge, abstaining from music, Google Maps, WhatsApp, and the internet.

This innovation aims to provide natural and sustainable lighting for areas like village roads, hiking trails, and small zones requiring visibility without the need for external power sources.</p> <p>To create this GMO, the focus is on introducing bioluminescent traits found in organisms like fireflies into Quercus ilex.

While fireflies naturally exhibit this trait, the goal is to transfer the genes associated with luciferase enzyme production and luciferin binding into Quercus ilex.</p> <p>The process involves genomic analysis of fireflies to identify key genes, including luciferase (Luc1) and luciferin-binding proteins. Genetic modification would then integrate the firefly luciferase gene into Quercus ilex plant cells. The challenge lies in enabling the plant to produce luciferin independently without relying on external chemical fuel for sustained bioluminescence. While genetically modifying the tree to synthesize luciferin is a potential solution, there are also alternative approaches that involve exploring how the plant might absorb luciferin, possibly through watering with a firefly compound. However, this method introduces the need for an external chemical fuel, which contradicts the objective of creating self-sustaining, off-grid lighting solutions.</p> <p>Creating bioluminescent Quercus ilex trees is theoretically achievable through genetic modification, borrowing traits from fireflies. The challenge lies in developing a self-sustaining system where the trees generate light without external chemical inputs.

It goes beyond merely contributing to a community; it involves understanding how to perpetuate the underlying philosophy and design principles over time. The visit also shed light on the integral role of politics in design and the often-overlooked possibilities within our reach. Additionally, we delved back into the socio-ethnic aspects discussed on the first day of class, with a focus on the \u201cland\u201d component\u2014everything from homes to creative spaces. This aspect offered me a fresh perspective on designing for others, even within our own human context. More than a technical learning experience for the master\u2019s program, it allowed me to explore different facets of Barcelona. It made me realize that, despite being a resident of this city, there is still much to learn, especially from these marvelous projects.

Secondly, there\u2019s the consideration of life after the master\u2019s. While the master\u2019s program is great for reflection and bringing about change from a unique designer\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s the lingering question of how these ideas apply in the professional world. How do we bring about change, earn a living, have a life, and still maintain these perspectives? Getting to know my master\u2019s community and potential future connections has given me a clearer vision of what might come after the master\u2019s.

Although Barcelona has a lot of green areas, they are not connected, creating \u201cdeserts\u201d for animals like bees as they move from one green space to another.</p> <p>We decided to focus on promoting biodiversity on a specific street in Poblenou, creating a green corridor where pollinating species could live within the city. We chose the Poble Nou area due to its proximity to IAAC, which would facilitate contact and exploration of spaces after classes. We selected a street that connected two known spaces: BAM and NestCityLab. BAM (Associai\u00f3 Bioarquitectura Meditarr\u00e0nea) is a community garden that we have already visited and that promotes bee life. NestCityLab is a green building with an internal garden, although its green space is closed to the outside. We wanted to communicate with them to open the space and promote the biodiversity corridor in Poble Nou.</p> <p>By choosing these spaces, we were interested in finding solutions to contribute to these communities actively interested in the subject. Initially, we thought about providing a product, such as a vertical farm, but we realized that this product designer perspective would lead us to offer a solution and then disappear from the community.</p> <p>So, we developed a plan over several months considering the limited duration of our presence at IAAC. We wanted to build a community interested in the project. We started with a discovery and information stage, conducting an advertising campaign to inform people on the street about our initiative.

Here, we portrayed ourselves as bees on that street. This representation prompted profound reflection, as we walked the street twice\u2014first as humans and then as bees. During our human walk, we observed a lack of greenery, despite attempts to introduce gardens or trees. However, the absence of flowers didn\u2019t strike us much at the time, and we continued walking. Yet, when we assumed the role of bees (considering this exercise took place in winter with fewer plants), we realized that despite our movement from one place to another, these nature deserts persisted. This made it challenging for bees, butterflies, birds, and other animals to navigate from one location to another.</p> <p>This marks the culmination of our project up to this phase of the activity.

It allowed me to perceive the city from a different perspective, viewing its issues and conflicts that we often overlook in our daily lives through different eyes. I also realized that creating solutions for a community involves engaging with and learning from that community. Contrary to the common approach where designers provide a solution, typically a product, to a community and then disengage, I\u2019ve come to understand that this isn\u2019t necessarily the only way to solve a problem. Designing for a community means becoming an integral part of it, actively contributing to constant change, and not abandoning the community once the design phase is completed.</p> <p>Moreover, this seminar has given me a new perspective on my city. While Barcelona has always seemed well-managed for humans, I now recognize, for the first time, that the city is exclusively designed for humans, lacking pathways for biodiversity and not fostering significant change. It also prompted reflection on the fact that solutions are often generated on a small scale, and this change can lead to conflicts in other spaces.

Clearly, this project was more about my personal exploration into AI and identity. I didn\u2019t expect it to impact society but rather to affect my own understanding and approach to the topic. Using this tool made me realize that my previous projects related to AI and identity have been quite self-centered and subjective. I may need to reconsider how I approach my projects. While it\u2019s challenging to connect AI to sustainability, I could strive to make my projects more open and collaborative.

This project greatly helped us understand data collection, especially in the subjective realm of emotions, which are challenging to measure accurately. It was challenging to guide people through the voting process as we limited responses to streamline our study. However, numerous factors interact with emotions, making it difficult to ascertain whether individuals genuinely felt happy or not.</p> <p>In conclusion, we were able to test our hypothesis that music indeed influences mood changes. However, various factors influenced our data collection, making it challenging to determine conclusively whether the music we selected was the sole reason for people\u2019s mood changes. Additionally, the data collection spanned only two days, limiting the formation of a well-rounded conclusion. Even though we observed mood changes, it does not explicitly confirm that the chosen music was the cause.</p> <p>If you want to see the actual technical parts and process of the activity, you can read our Journal.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term2/06-Measuring/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":"<p>Let\u2019s get physical de so.marandon</p>"},{"location":"term2/06-Measuring/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>I\u2019ve been highly intrigued by this course, given that my thesis revolves around artificial intelligence and technology usage. At present, my goal is to create an artificial intelligence clone of myself that can react to my instructions and mimic my behavior. However, a significant challenge I\u2019ve encountered is the accurate collection of data, a crucial aspect for feeding this artificial intelligence.</p> <p>The seminar on this subject has captured my interest, and I\u2019m eager to delve deeper into it. Data collection fascinates me, and the opportunity to explore various tools that are new to me, while also engaging more with technology, is quite appealing. Although I utilized a physical tool for a previous project, I would have preferred a more tech-oriented data collection approach with technological components like cameras, aligning with the focus of my thesis.</p> <p>Additionally, I\u2019m keen on further exploring the realm of APIs to gather data not only about myself but also about others. I\u2019m particularly interested in delving into the concept of sensors and understanding how to capture information from our surroundings. Currently, my primary focus is on developing technology that responds to our emotions and personalities, necessitating a robust database and precise data analysis to comprehend the reactions to the detected actions and gain insights into our surroundings.</p>"}]}
